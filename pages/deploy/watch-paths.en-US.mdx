# Watch Paths

After your service is deployed, you may often update your code, but some code updates do not require a service to be redeployed.

For example, in a project where the front-end and back-end code are in the same Git repository, you may have only updated the back-end code, but after committing, you find that the front-end service is redeployed as well.

To avoid this, simply go to the settings and modify the watch paths:

### Step 1: Open the service settings page

Click on the service you want to modify the configuration for, and select the settings page. You will see an input box **Watch paths** where you can modify the service's watch paths.

### Step 2: Modify the watch paths

You will see that the default watch path is `*`, which means that the service triggers the entire repository, and any file updates in the repository will result in a service redeployment.

You can modify your watch paths in the same format as the `.gitignore` file.

The only difference is that `.gitignore` represents ignore, and here represents trigger.

For example, you have deployed a full-stack application, and the code format is as follows:

And you have deployed two services for this repository, one service with the root directory set to `client` and the other to `server`, but this is just to specify the build path. To further isolate, you need to set the **Watch paths**.

For example, after setting the **Watch paths** of the client service to `/client`, any updates you make in the `server` folder will no longer automatically trigger the client service to be redeployed.
