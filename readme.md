## Intro

Zeabur is a platform that help developers deploy their services with one click. 

No matter what programming language or framework is used.

## Features

### One click deployment

Zeabur can automatically analyze the code to determine what language and framework the project uses. No more dockerfile or docker-compose.yml!

All you need to do is to push your code to the repository, and Zeabur will automatically deploy and update your services.

### Powerful configuration

Zeabur provides a powerful configuration system, which allows you to easily configure your services.

- Configure your environment variables easily, without `.env` files.
- Add domains for your services with one click. You can use your own domain or just use a subdomain of `zeabur.app`.
- Multiple environment support, such as `production`, `staging`, `development`, and so on. Bind different domains and branches to different environments to get a separate environment easily.

### Pay as you go

Are you still 'renting a server'? Zeabur uses a pay-as-you-go model, so you only pay for the resources your service actually uses, and you don't pay for what you don't use!

### Integration

Your powerful system needs many different services to work together, such as MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Elastic Search, and so on. 

Zeabur can help you easily deploy them in the same place, reduce management costs, and improve transmission speeds.

### Easy to manage

After deployment, you can easily manage your services through the dashboard.

- You can check the status or usages of your services, your them.
- Rollback, suspend or restart your services with one click.
- Invite your team members to manage your services together!
- You can also see a detailed log of your services.
