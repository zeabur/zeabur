# Contribution Reward Program

To encourage developers to help Zeabur enrich the content of [templates](https://zeabur.com/templates) and [documentation](https://zeabur.com/docs), making it easier and more convenient for other developers to use Zeabur, we are launching the "Contribution Reward Program" to offer free usage credits to contributors.

Refer to the following contribution methods, then let us know your contribution in the Discord channel. We will grant you the corresponding free usage credits based on your contribution.

Please note that the reward free credits mentioned on this page are not fixed amounts. We will decide the reward value based on factors such as the content, quality, and difficulty of your contribution. We recommend discussing your contribution with us before you begin to ensure you can earn the maximum reward.

## Contributing Templates

The ways to contribute templates mainly include creating templates, supplementing templates, and translating templates.

### Creating Templates

Creating templates helps other developers deploy more open-source projects to Zeabur with one click. Refer to [Creating Templates from YAML](../template/template-in-code) to learn how to create templates.

Each created template can earn you at least **$10** in free usage credits, but the template must satisfy **all** of the following conditions:

1. The template must not duplicate existing templates unless it is a new version or intended for a different scenario or purpose.
2. The template must include complete information, including the template name, description, cover image, introduction, and usage instructions.
3. The template introduction must have at least an English version.
4. The template must be deployable with one click. If extra steps are needed after deployment, those need to be documented in the template introduction.

Aside from these necessary conditions, to prevent abuse of our contribution reward program, we also require your created templates to meet at least **one** of these conditions:

1. The associated open-source project has more than 500 stars on GitHub.
2. The associated open-source project already has one-click deployment buttons or templates on other PaaS platforms and has been used more than 30 times.

Bonus: If your template is used by other developers more than 30 times (must continue running after deployment), you will receive an additional **$20** in free usage credits.

### Supplementing Templates

Supplementing templates refers to providing additional content for existing templates. For example, if a template requires extra setup steps after deployment for usage, but those steps are not documented, you can supplement this information.

Each supplemented template can earn you at least **$5** in free usage credits, but the supplemented template must satisfy **all** of the following conditions:

1. The template must have been deployed more than 30 times.
2. The supplemented content must provide tangible help, such as supplementing the template introduction, usage instructions, or deployment steps.

Another situation is when the template setup itself is problematic, preventing it from being successfully deployed and started with a single click. In this case, you can help us fix this template and supplement the relevant instructions, which can also earn you **$5** in free usage credits.

### Translating Templates

Translating templates involves providing translations for existing templates. For example, if a template introduction is only in English, you can provide translations in other languages.

Each translated template can earn you at least **$5** in free usage credits, but the translated template must satisfy **all** of the following conditions:

1. The template must have been deployed more than 30 times.
2. The translated content must be complete, including template introductions and fields such as variable names and descriptions.
3. You must translate into languages supported on the template page, including English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish.

## How to Get Started

If you want to participate in the contribution reward program, please first join [Zeabur's Discord channel](https://zeabur.com/dc) and let us know that you are interested in participating in the contribution reward program. Tell us which template or documentation page you plan to submit, supplement, or translate.

If you want to earn free credits through the contribution reward program but don't know which open-source project to create a template for, or which template to fix or translate, you can also contact us. We can inform you of other users' needs.

If you encounter any issues during the contribution process, you can also tell us directly, helping us make the contribution process smoother.
