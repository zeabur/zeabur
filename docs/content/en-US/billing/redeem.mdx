# Redeem Prepaid Card

Sometimes, you may purchase or receive a Zeabur prepaid card from third-party partners who collaborate with Zeabur. These prepaid cards can be redeemed for Zeabur service balance, which you can use to upgrade to Zeabur paid membership, purchase dedicated servers, or pay for shared cluster usage.

This article will teach you how to redeem your purchased or received Zeabur prepaid card to your balance.

## How to Redeem

1. Log in to your Zeabur account. If you don't have a Zeabur account yet, please [register](https://zeabur.com/login) first.
2. Visit the billing management page of the Zeabur console at [https://zeabur.com/account/billing](https://zeabur.com/account/billing).
3. You can find the "Account Balance" section on the billing management page. Click the "Redeem Points" button in the upper right corner.
4. Enter your prepaid card code in the popup dialog, then click the "Redeem" button.
5. If the redemption is successful, you will see a success notification in the lower right corner of the screen. Your account balance will be increased by the corresponding amount.
