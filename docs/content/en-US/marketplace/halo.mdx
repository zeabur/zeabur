# Deploy Halo

[Halo](https://www.halo.run/) is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source website building tool. With a rich set of templates and plugins, it helps you build your ideal website.

This article will guide you on how to easily deploy your own Halo service on Zeabur through the service marketplace and bind your own domain name.

## Step 1: Open the Halo Template Page

Since Halo requires a separate database service, you cannot complete the deployment with just a standalone Halo image.

We have created a template for you that can deploy Halo with PostgreSQL in one click.

## Step 2: Deploy the Template

Click the deploy button and choose a region to deploy your service.

After selecting, you will be automatically redirected to the project page where you can see the deployment progress.

Wait a few seconds, and your Halo service will be successfully deployed and start running.

## Step 3: Bind Domain Name

After deployment, you need to bind a domain name to access your Halo service.

You can follow the [domain binding guide](/deploy/domain-binding) for more details.

After binding the domain name, the next time you restart the Halo service, it will automatically set this domain as the external access address for Halo, without needing to set it manually again.

## Step 4: Login and Set Up Halo

After completing domain binding, you can click the domain to enter the Halo initialization interface.

After initialization and login, you can jump to the Halo console.

## Subsequent Maintenance

### Upgrade Version

To upgrade the version of Halo later, just change the version number of the image in the service settings, as shown:

The list of Halo versions can be viewed at [halohub/halo](https://hub.docker.com/r/halohub/halo/tags), and the release notes can be found at: [Halo Official Site - Release Notes](https://www.halo.run/categories/release-notes)

<Callout>
After changing the image version, the service will automatically restart, and the upgrade will be completed after a short wait.
</Callout>

### Backup and Migration

Although Zeabur also provides a backup function for services, Halo's built-in backup feature is platform-independent, so it is more recommended to use Halo's built-in backup feature for backups.

Moreover, if you need to migrate your existing Halo service to Zeabur, using Halo's backup and restore function is also a better choice.

For instructions on using Halo's backup and restore features, refer to: [Halo Documentation - Backup and Restore](https://docs.halo.run/user-guide/backup)
