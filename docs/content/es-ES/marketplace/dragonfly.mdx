# Deploy Dragonfly Service

<WorkingInProgress />

[Dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydb.io/) is a simple, high-performance, low-cost in-memory data storage. Dragonfly is fully compatible with the Redis API but without the complexity of managing Redis.

This article will teach you how to deploy your own Dragonfly service on Zeabur via the Service Market.

## Step 1: Create a Project

## Step 2: Deploy Dragonfly Service

You can deploy the Dragonfly service with one click in the service market.

## Step 3: Get Connection Info

After you deploy the Dragonfly service, Zeabur will automatically inject the environment variables needed for connection into other services for you.

- `DRAGONFLY_HOST`
- `DRAGONFLY_PORT`
- `DRAGONFLY_PASSWORD`

Sometimes we can use `DRAGONFLY_URI` instead of the above environment variables, for example:

```bash
redis://:${DRAGONFLY_PASSWORD}@${DRAGONFLY_HOST}:${DRAGONFLY_PORT}
```

We can also find the connection information in the "Instructions" section on the console.

## Step 4: Start Using

You can use the connection information above to connect to the Dragonfly service in your application or client.

Since Dragonfly is fully compatible with Redis API, you can connect to the Dragonfly service using any client that supports Redis.
