# Deploy Botway CE on Zeabur

Zeabur provides a one-click deployment feature for the Botway CE service, enabling you to swiftly set up Botway CE on Zeabur.

## Deploying Botway CE Service

In your project, click **Create Service**, select **Marketplace** and then search for `Botway CE`.

After selecting "Botway CE", Zeabur will automatically deploy the Botway CE service for you.

## Environment Variables

After the Botway CE service is successfully deployed, Zeabur will automatically inject environment variables into the service. Currently, the following variables are available:

- `GIT_REPO`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `PASSWORD`
- `PKGS`

## Connecting to Botway CE

Here I use Zeabur's built-in Generate Domain feature to create a Domain, click Generate Domain in the **Networking** section.

Once it's created, open the Domain and enter the password from the `PASSWORD` environment variable to begin using Botway CE.
