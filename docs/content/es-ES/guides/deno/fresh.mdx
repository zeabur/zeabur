# Deploy Fresh App

[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) is a full stack modern web framework for JavaScript and TypeScript.

This article will teach you how to deploy your Fresh App in Zeabur in one click.

## Create Fresh App (Optional)

- Install Deno on your computer.

- You can see a more detailed instruction in [Deno's official documentation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

Use the command to initialize a Deno project with Fresh framework.

```bash
deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev my-project
```

In `main.ts`, add `port: Deno.env.get("PORT")` to the start function in order to make sure the application can listen correctly on the environment variable `PORT` given by Zeabur.

```typescript
// in main.ts
await start(manifest, { plugins: [twindPlugin(twindConfig)], port: Deno.env.get("PORT")}, );
```

## Develop

Run `deno task start` to start the development server.

```bash
deno task start
```

Init a GitHub repository for it and upload to your GitHub.

## Deploy

Click on **Add new service** button, then choose **Deploy your source code**.
