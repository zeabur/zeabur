# Introduction

**Zeabur** is a platform that help you deploy your service with one click,
No matter what programming language you use, what framework you use.

You can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DrdGCvXEyY) to learn more and get a priority support!

### Advantages of Zeabur

#### Convenient and Fast

Compared to traditional deployment methods, Zeabur allows you to complete deployment in just a few minutes without spending a lot of time learning about deployment-related knowledge. This allows you to focus your time and energy on product development.

- Out-of-the-box CI/CD
- Automatic project type recognition
- Quickly generate domains
- Multiple environment isolation

#### Pay-as-You-Go

Zeabur adopts a pay-as-you-go billing method, which means you only need to pay for the actual resources used by your service, instead of paying for the entire server.

You can learn more detailed information on [the pricing document](/en-US/billing/pricing).

#### All-in-One Integration

Zeabur provides powerful all-in-one integration capabilities.

You can deploy various services such as front-end, back-end, databases, message queues, and object storage in one project, without having to deploy them separately to different platforms.
