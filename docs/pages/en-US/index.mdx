### **Advantages of Zeabur**

- User-friendly and intuitive UI
- Out-of-the-box CI/CD
- Automatic domain generation / Bring Your Own Domain (BYOD) support

### **All-in-One Integration**

Zeabur provides powerful all-in-one integration capabilities.

You can deploy various services such as front-end, back-end, databases, message queues, and object storage in a single project, without having to deploy them separately to different platforms.

### One Click Deploy Templates

Zeabur provides a vast library of templates in our [Template Marketplace](https://zeabur.com/templates). Simply click the `Deploy` button, and your template will begin deploying immediately. Within minutes, whether you are deploying a database or an application like n8n, it will be ready to use.

For more details, you can learn more on the [Zeabur Templates page](https://zeabur.com/templates).

### Zeabur AI Hub

Zeabur AI Hub is a unified platform designed to simplify access to powerful AI models for developers. Instead of managing separate accounts and API keys for different providers, you can access the industry's most popular models through a single interface.

- **Unified Access**: Access major models like OpenAI (GPT series), Anthropic (Claude series), Google (Gemini), xAI (Grok), and open-source models (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen) all in one place.
- **Single API Key**: Use one simple API key to call any supported model, eliminating the complexity of managing multiple credentials.
- **OpenAI Compatible**: The API is fully compatible with the OpenAI API format, allowing you to easily integrate it into existing applications or tools like n8n and SillyTavern without code changes.
- **Global Low Latency**: With API endpoints deployed in multiple regions (such as Tokyo and San Francisco), you can choose the closest server to ensure optimal performance.

You can learn more and get started at the [Zeabur AI Hub page](https://zeabur.com/ai-hub).

### **Pay-as-You-Go**

Zeabur adopts a pay-as-you-go billing method, which means you only pay for the actual resources used by your service, rather than paying for an entire server.

You can learn more detailed information in [the pricing documentation](https://zeabur.com/docs/en-US/billing/pricing).
