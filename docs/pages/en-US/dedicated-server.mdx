# Dedicated Server

You can use Zeabur to easily deploy various services to two different types of servers: Shared Cluster and Dedicated Server. These two types of computing resources are suitable for different usage scenarios.

## Shared Cluster

The Shared Cluster is the simplest way to deploy services using Zeabur because you don't need to understand any server-related knowledge or settings, and you won't even perceive the concept of a server. You only need to choose the appropriate data center location.

Each Shared Cluster is a computing cluster composed of multiple servers managed by Zeabur. A cluster contains multiple servers, and the services you deploy will share these servers with other users who choose the same cluster.

The Shared Cluster is suitable for deploying services with fluctuating hardware demands because it uses a pay-as-you-go model. It can save costs when hardware demand is low and automatically scale up when demand is high, thus avoiding hardware resource shortages.

Currently, Zeabur has the following Shared Clusters:

- California, USA (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Frankfurt, Germany (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Tokyo, Japan (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Hong Kong (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Taipei (provided by Google Cloud) — available only for enterprise customers
- Singapore (provided by DigitalOcean) — available only for enterprise customers
- New Jersey, USA (provided by Vultr)

## Dedicated Server

A Dedicated Server is a server that belongs only to you, so your services will not be affected by other users' services, and the hardware resources are entirely yours, without being occupied by other users.

Dedicated Servers are suitable for the following scenarios:

- Users who have rented or purchased servers from other cloud providers can register their servers to Zeabur with one click, thus avoiding the need to pay for hardware resource usage.
- Users with high requirements for service stability and security, such as production environments for large systems.
- Users whose main service access area does not have a Shared Cluster region can rent or build a Dedicated Server that meets their geographical location.

You can create multiple projects on a Dedicated Server, but you need to pay attention to the hardware resource usage of these services to avoid service impact due to insufficient hardware resources on the Dedicated Server.

## Register a Dedicated Server

You can choose to purchase a Dedicated Server on Zeabur (under development) or register a server you have already rented or purchased from other cloud providers.

If you want to know how to register your server, you can refer to [Register a Dedicated Server](./dedicated-server/register).

## Known Limitations

- Currently, Dedicated Servers do not support Serverless deployment.
- Currently, Dedicated Servers do not support the `.zeabur.app` free subdomain. You need to have your own domain to bind to the services deployed on the Dedicated Server.
