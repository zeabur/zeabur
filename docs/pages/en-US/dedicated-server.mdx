# Dedicated Server

You can use Zeabur to easily deploy various services to two different types of servers: Shared Cluster and Dedicated Server. These two types of computing resources are suitable for different usage scenarios.

## Shared Cluster

The Shared Cluster is the simplest way to deploy services using Zeabur because you don't need to understand any server-related knowledge or settings, and you won't even perceive the concept of a server. You only need to choose the appropriate data center location.

Each Shared Cluster is a computing cluster composed of multiple servers managed by Zeabur. A cluster contains multiple servers, and the services you deploy will share these servers with other users who choose the same cluster.

The Shared Cluster is suitable for deploying services with fluctuating hardware demands because it uses a pay-as-you-go model. It can save costs when hardware demand is low and automatically scale up when demand is high, thus avoiding hardware resource shortages.

Currently, Zeabur has the following Shared Clusters:

- California, USA (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Frankfurt, Germany (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Tokyo, Japan (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Hong Kong (provided by Amazon Web Services)
- Taipei (provided by Google Cloud) — available only for enterprise customers

## Dedicated Server

A Dedicated Server is a server that belongs only to you, so your services will not be affected by other users' services, and the hardware resources are entirely yours, without being occupied by other users.

Dedicated Servers are suitable for the following scenarios:

- Users who have rented or purchased servers from other cloud providers can register their servers to Zeabur with one click, thus avoiding the need to pay for hardware resource usage.
- Users with high requirements for service stability and security, such as production environments for large systems.
- Users whose main service access area does not have a Shared Cluster region can rent or build a Dedicated Server that meets their geographical location.

You can create multiple projects on a Dedicated Server, but you need to pay attention to the hardware resource usage of these services to avoid service impact due to insufficient hardware resources on the Dedicated Server.

## Register a Dedicated Server

You can choose to purchase a dedicated server on Zeabur or register a server that you have already rented or purchased from another cloud service provider.

If you want to learn how to register your own server, you can refer to [Register a Dedicated Server](/dedicated-server/register).

If you want to purchase a dedicated server from Zeabur, you can go to "My Servers" → "Create" → "Purchase Server from Zeabur" to make your selection. After choosing to purchase, we will deduct the amount from your Zeabur balance or credit card. The purchase process is as follows:

## Connecting via SSH

For dedicated servers purchased from Zeabur, you can connect via SSH by following these steps:

### Step 1: Reveal the SSH Password

Navigate to your server's info page and click on the SSH Password field to reveal it.

### Step 2: Connect Using SSH

Once you have revealed the password, use the IP Address, SSH Username, and SSH Password shown on the server info page to connect via SSH.

![SSH Connection Details](/dedicated-server/ssh-step-2.png)

You can connect using a terminal with the following command:

```bash
ssh <username>@<ip-address>
```

Then enter the password when prompted.

  Once you change the SSH password, Zeabur will no longer be able to provide technical support for this server. Please proceed with caution.
