# Register Dedicated Server

This article will explain how to register a [Dedicated Server](../dedicated-server) on Zeabur.

## Prerequisites

- You already have a server, and this server must have at least one public IP address that can be connected to.
- The server must have at least 1 CPU core and at least 2 GB of memory.
- The server must have the following ports open: `22`, `80`, `443`, `4222`, `6443`, `30000-32767`.
- The server must allow SSH login, and the username must be `root`.
- The server must allow `root` user to log in using a password or SSH key.

## Registration Steps

1. After logging into Zeabur, click on "My Servers" in the top navigation bar or at the top of the project list page, or directly visit [https://dash.zeabur.com/servers](https://dash.zeabur.com/servers).
2. Click the "Create" button in the upper right corner of the page.
3. Enter the server's IP address and SSH port (default is `22`).
4. Choose the method for the `root` user to log in via SSH: password or SSH key.
5. If you choose a password, enter the password below; if you choose an SSH key, enter the SSH key below.
6. Click the "Add Server" button and wait for the server registration to complete (this process takes about 30 seconds).
7. After successful registration, you will see the newly registered server in the server list.
8. Wait about a minute until the status shows "Online" and the CPU and memory usage can be displayed normally.

If you encounter registration failure, please report it to us on the [Discord server](https://zeabur.com/dc).

## Uninstallation

First, you need to remove the server and the services deployed on it from Zeabur.

![Remove Server](/dedicated-server/remove-server.webp)

The steps for removing the server **will not remove the infrastructure set up by Zeabur on your server**. Zeabur's infrastructure is primarily built on [K3s](https://k3s.io/), so the uninstallation steps should [follow the K3s uninstallation instructions](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).

```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```

## Free Up Your Disk Space

If you notice that the host's free space is low, you can clean up the Docker images pulled by K3s on your host. Note that this task is usually automated.

```bash
# Check which images are currently pulled (you don't need to type this line)
$ sudo k3s crictl images

# Remove all unused images
$ sudo k3s crictl rmi --prune
```

Sometimes the logs from K3s for each container can also take up a significant amount of space. You can try clearing these logs in the [K3s logs directory](https://docs.k3s.io/faq#where-are-the-k3s-logs).
