# Maintain your Dedicated Server

This article will introduce how to maintain your [dedicated server](../dedicated-server) registered with Zeabur.

<Callout>
    If you purchased a dedicated server from Zeabur, the operation and maintenance tasks are performed by us.
    Please submit a ticket to let us know which project you want to maintain, and our staff will handle it for you.

## Space Cleanup

If you find that the disk space on your host is insufficient, you can try cleaning up the Docker images pulled by K3s on your host (this is usually done automatically).

```bash
# Check which images have been pulled (no need to type this line)
$ sudo k3s crictl images

# Remove all unused images
$ sudo k3s crictl rmi --prune
```

Sometimes, the logs recorded by K3s for each container can also take up a lot of space. You can try cleaning these logs in the [K3s logs directory](https://docs.k3s.io/faq#where-are-the-k3s-logs).

## Changing DNS Nameservers

By default, Zeabur's dedicated servers use [Cloudflare DNS](https://1.1.1.1/) as the DNS nameservers for the cluster (machines in mainland China use [Alibaba Cloud Public DNS](https://www.alidns.com/)).

If you need to change the DNS nameservers used by the cluster (for example, to Tencent Cloud's [DNSPod Public DNS](https://www.dnspod.cn/products/publicdns)), you can edit `/etc/resolv.kubelet.conf` and change the `nameserver` to the DNS nameservers you want.

```
nameserver 119.29.29.29
```

Remember to restart the K3s service after making changes.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart k3s
```

## Starting and Stopping K3s and Containerd

If you need to manually start or stop the K3s or containerd services, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your dedicated server via SSH:

```bash
ssh <username>@<server IP>
```

### K3s

- Stop the K3s service:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now k3s
```

- Start the K3s service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now k3s
```

### Containerd

- Stop the containerd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now containerd
```

- Start the containerd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
```

> Note: Stopping these services will cause all containers and services running on the server to stop. Please proceed with caution.

## Using VS Code for Remote Development

You can use [VS Code Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) to connect to your dedicated server and directly edit files or operate containers in a familiar IDE environment.

### Step 1: Install the Remote-SSH Extension

Open VS Code and install the **Remote - SSH** extension from the Extensions Marketplace.

### Step 2: Set Up SSH Key Authentication

Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine (if you don't have one) and add the public key to the server:

```bash
# Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Copy the public key to the server
$ ssh-copy-id <username>@<server-ip>
```

If `ssh-copy-id` is not available, you can manually append the public key:

```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh <username>@<server-ip> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### Step 3: Connect via VS Code

Open the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`), select **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host**, and enter `<username>@<server-ip>` to connect.

### Step 4: Locate the Service's File Storage Path

After connecting, you will be at the server's root directory. To find where your service's files are stored, first locate the PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) for your service, then find the corresponding PV (Persistent Volume) and its host path.

The PVC name follows the format `<volume-id>-service-<service-id>`, located in the namespace `environment-<environment-id>`.

```bash
# List all PVCs to find your service's volume
$ kubectl get pvc -A

# Find the PV that the PVC is bound to
$ kubectl get pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.volumeName}'

# Get the host path of the corresponding PV
$ kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.local.path}'
```

You can then open this path in VS Code using **File → Open Folder** to start editing your service's files.

### Step 5: Access a Container Shell

To get a terminal environment inside your service's container (equivalent to the Web Terminal on Zeabur):

```bash
# List pods in a namespace
$ kubectl get pods -n <namespace>

# Open a shell in a pod
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/sh
```

## Uninstallation

First, you need to remove the server and the services deployed on it from Zeabur.

![Remove Server](/dedicated-server/remove-server.webp)

The "Remove Server" step **will not remove the infrastructure set up by Zeabur on your server**. Zeabur's infrastructure is primarily built on [K3s](https://k3s.io/), so the uninstallation steps [follow the K3s uninstallation steps](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).

```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```
