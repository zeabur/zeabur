# Maintain your Dedicated Server

This article will introduce how to maintain your [dedicated server](../dedicated-server) registered with Zeabur.

<Callout>
    If you purchased a dedicated server from Zeabur, the operation and maintenance tasks are performed by us.
    Please submit a ticket to let us know which project you want to maintain, and our staff will handle it for you.

## Space Cleanup

If you find that the disk space on your host is insufficient, you can try cleaning up the Docker images pulled by K3s on your host (this is usually done automatically).

```bash
# Check which images have been pulled (no need to type this line)
$ sudo k3s crictl images

# Remove all unused images
$ sudo k3s crictl rmi --prune
```

Sometimes, the logs recorded by K3s for each container can also take up a lot of space. You can try cleaning these logs in the [K3s logs directory](https://docs.k3s.io/faq#where-are-the-k3s-logs).

## Changing DNS Nameservers

By default, Zeabur's dedicated servers use [Cloudflare DNS](https://1.1.1.1/) as the DNS nameservers for the cluster (machines in mainland China use [Alibaba Cloud Public DNS](https://www.alidns.com/)).

If you need to change the DNS nameservers used by the cluster (for example, to Tencent Cloud's [DNSPod Public DNS](https://www.dnspod.cn/products/publicdns)), you can edit `/etc/resolv.kubelet.conf` and change the `nameserver` to the DNS nameservers you want.

```
nameserver 119.29.29.29
```

Remember to restart the K3s service after making changes.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart k3s
```

## Uninstallation

First, you need to remove the server and the services deployed on it from Zeabur.

![Remove Server](/dedicated-server/remove-server.webp)

The "Remove Server" step **will not remove the infrastructure set up by Zeabur on your server**. Zeabur's infrastructure is primarily built on [K3s](https://k3s.io/), so the uninstallation steps [follow the K3s uninstallation steps](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).

```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```
