</Callout>

### Step 3: Use the API

Using the Zeabur AI Hub API is the same as using the OpenAI API. You just need to:

1. Set the API Base URL to the Zeabur AI Hub endpoint
2. Use the API key you created in AI Hub

```bash
curl https://hnd1.aihub.zeabur.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ZEABUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Billing

AI Hub uses a **prepaid credits system**:

1. Add credits to your account first
2. Each API call deducts the corresponding credits based on the model used and token count
3. View detailed usage records and costs in "Usage History"

### View Usage Records

On the AI Hub page:
1. Go to the "Usage History" tab
2. View detailed information for each API call:
   - Timestamp
   - Model name
   - Token usage
   - Credits consumed

## Security Best Practices

- **Protect Your API Key**: Do not commit API keys to version control systems
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables
- **Regular Rotation**: Periodically revoke old API keys and create new ones
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check usage history for unusual API calls

## Integration Examples

Zeabur AI Hub can be easily integrated into various applications and tools:

- [Using Zeabur AI Hub in n8n](./n8n-integration): Workflow automation
- [Using Zeabur AI Hub in SillyTavern](./sillytavern-integration): Role-playing conversations
