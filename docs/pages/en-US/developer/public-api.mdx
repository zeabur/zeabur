# Public API Reference

Zeabur public API is built with GraphQL. It's the same API that powers our dashboard and CLI.

## Endpoint

You can access the Zeabur API via the following endpoint:

```http
https://gateway.zeabur.com/graphql
```

## Authentication

To get started with the Zeabur API, you need to create an account and generate an API key. You can create one by visiting the [Developer Panel](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/developer).

You can also check [this documentation](./use-api-key) for more information on how to generate an API key.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://gateway.zeabur.com/graphql \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"query":"query { me { username } }"}'
```

## Schema

### Deploy Codes on Zeabur

You can deploy your code on Zeabur with the deploy API without linking a GitHub repository. You can use this API to deploy your code from your local machine or any other source.

To deploy codes on Zeabur, you will need a project ID, service ID, and environment ID. You can get these IDs from the dashboard or CLI or just create a new project and service through API.

Then you will need to zip your code and send it to the API.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://gateway.zeabur.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/services/{SERVICE_ID}/deploy \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}' \
  --data '{"code": {YOUR_CODE_AS_ZIP_FILE}, "environment": {ENVIRONMENT_ID}}'
```

### Retrieve Projects

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://gateway.zeabur.com/graphql \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"query":"query { projects { _id name } }"}'
```
