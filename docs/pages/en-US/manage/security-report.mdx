# Security Report

Zeabur provides a built-in security report feature that uses AI analysis to detect potential security vulnerabilities in your applications.

The security report feature employs AI-powered intelligent analysis to check for many common security vulnerabilities (such as industry standards like OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25), including Secret Key exposure, SQL injection, XSS attacks, and more. With just one click, you can complete a scan and generate a report within 5-10 minutes.

## How to Generate a Security Report
