## Free Trial Plan

By default, all Zeabur accounts are Free Trial Plan.

You can evaluate any service with this plan, but services can only be deployed in specific free regions. After upgrading, you can migrate to other paid regions.

This plan is only suitable for testing and evaluation.

## Developer Plan

The Developer Plan is suitable for all kinds of developers and small teams. In addition to generous resource quotas, higher support priority, and exclusive "Dev Plan" badge on the Discord server, you can also "pay as you go" and create various interesting applications with Zeabur without worrying about restrictions.

The Developer Plan has a US$5 free quota each month:

- If your usage in a month does not exceed US$5, we will not charge you any additional fees other than this plan.
- If the usage exceeds US$5, the excess usage will be charged according to the formula in ["Pricing"](./pricing).

## Team Plan

The Team Plan is suitable for medium and large-scale, or projects with large resource requirements. In addition to providing more resource quotas, you can also directly connect with the Zeabur team to discuss various possibilities.

Supports credit card and Alipay payments. When you need other payment methods, you can communicate with us.

## Enterprise Plan

If the Team Plan does not meet your needs, you can [contact us](mailto:contact@zeabur.com) to get a plan tailored to your usage scenario.
