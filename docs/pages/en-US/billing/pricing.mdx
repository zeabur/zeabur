# Pricing

Zeabur offers a consumption-based pricing model for your projects. You won't get any bills for resources you don't use.

Instead, Zeabur charges by the minute for each resource that your services actually use.

## Pricing Rates

There are two kinds of servers in Zeabur: _shared clusters_ and [_dedicated servers_](/dedicated-server). These pricing rates apply only to **shared clusters**, and we do not charge a usage fee for dedicated servers.

The rates for usage in the **shared clusters** are as the following:

- vCPU - No cost ($0.00 / vCPU-minute)

- Memory - **US$0.00025** / GB-minute (approx. US$10.80 / GB-month)
  - You will only be charged for the memory your services actually use. If your service crashes or is suspended, you won't incur any memory usage charges.

- Network Egress - **US$0.10** / GB (US$10.00 / 100GB)
  - 1GB accommodates about 1,000 unique visitors accessing your 1MiB page without a CDN or compression.
  - [Private networking](/networking/private) does not count as egress bandwidth.

- Persistent Volume - **US$0.20** / GB-month

## Refunds

For any refund issues, please contact us on [our Discord server](https://zeabur.com/dc).

For the **Developer Plan** or **Team Plan**, you can request a refund for the remaining balance if you cancel your subscription. For example, if you cancel your Developer Plan after using it for 10 days, you can receive a refund for the remaining 20 days. If you request a refund within 24 hours, you will receive a full refund.

For **Dedicated Server** users, Zeabur no longer supports refunds for servers created or renewed after July 21, 2025. To avoid being charged in the upcoming billing cycle, you can disable the auto-renewal settings.

> Please be noted, this only affects the servers created or renewed after July 21, 2025.
