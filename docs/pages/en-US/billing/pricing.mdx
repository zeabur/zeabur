# Pricing

Zeabur offers a consumption-based pricing model for your projects. You won't get any bills for resources you don't use.

Instead, Zeabur charges by the minute for each resource that your services actually use.

## Pricing Rates

There are two kinds of servers in Zeabur: _shared clusters_ and [_dedicated servers_](/dedicated-server). These pricing rates apply only to **shared clusters**, and we do not charge a usage fee for dedicated servers.

The rates for usage in the **shared clusters** are as the following:

- vCPU - No cost ($0.00 / vCPU-minute)

- Memory - **US$0.00025** / GB-minute (approx. US$10.80 / GB-month)
  - You will only be charged for the memory your services actually use. If your service crashes or is suspended, you won't incur any memory usage charges.

- Network Egress - **US$0.10** / GB (US$10.00 / 100GB)
  - 1GB accommodates about 1,000 unique visitors accessing your 1MiB page without a CDN or compression.
  - [Private networking](/networking/private) does not count as egress bandwidth.

- Persistent Volume - **US$0.20** / GB-month

## Refunds

For any refund issues, please contact us on [our Discord server](https://zeabur.com/dc).

### Servers and Subscription Plans

For **Dedicated Servers** and **Subscription Plans** (Developer Plan, Team Plan) purchased through **credit card or other non-credit payment methods**, refunds are allowed. You can choose to:

- Receive your refund as **Zeabur credits** — processed instantly after approval.
- Refund to your **original payment method** — may take up to 7 days, and you will need to pay the transaction fee.

### Purchases Made with Credits

For servers or subscription plans purchased using **Zeabur credits**, refunds can only be returned to your Zeabur credits balance.

### Purchased Credits

**Purchased credits are non-refundable.**
