# Pricing

Zeabur offers a consumption-based pricing model for your projects. You won’t get any bills for resources you don’t use.

Instead, Zeabur charges by the minute for each resource that your services actually use.

## Free Usage

- Free usage cannot be used to purchase machines.
- Free usage resets and is recalculated on the 1st day of every month.

## **Pricing Rates**

There are two kinds of servers in Zeabur: *shared clusters* and [*dedicated servers*](https://zeabur.com/docs/en-US/dedicated-server). These pricing rates apply only to **shared clusters**, and we do not charge a usage fee for dedicated servers.

The rates for usage in the **shared clusters** are as the following:

- vCPU - No cost ($0.00 / vCPU-minute)
- Memory - **US$0.00025** / GB-minute (approx. US$10.80 / GB-month)
    - You will only be charged for the memory your services actually use. If your service crashes or is suspended, you won’t incur any memory usage charges.
- Network Egress - **US$0.10** / GB (US$10.00 / 100GB)
    - 1GB accommodates about 1,000 unique visitors accessing your 1MiB page without a CDN or compression.
    - [Private networking](https://zeabur.com/docs/en-US/networking/private) does not count as egress bandwidth.
- Persistent Volume - **US$0.20** / GB-month

## **Refunds**

For any refund issues, please contact us on [Zeabur Forum](https://zeabur.com/forum).

For the **Developer Plan** or **Team Plan**, you can request a refund for the remaining balance if you cancel your subscription. For example, if you cancel your Developer Plan after using it for 10 days, you can receive a refund for the remaining 20 days. If you request a refund within 24 hours, you will receive a full refund.

For **Dedicated Server** users, Zeabur no longer supports refunds for servers created or renewed after July 21, 2025. To avoid being charged in the upcoming billing cycle, you can disable the auto-renewal settings.

> Please be noted, this only affects the servers created or renewed after July 21, 2025.

You can choose to receive your refund as Zeabur credits or back to your original payment method. If you opt for Zeabur credits, the refund is usually processed instantly after approval. If you choose to refund to your original payment method, it may take up to 7 days to process, and you will need to pay the Stripe transaction fee, which is approximately 30% of the amount refunded.
