# Import Guides

Built something in an AI builder or a cloud IDE? These guides help you **export the code**, **run it locally**, and **deploy it to Zeabur** with minimal configuration—so your app stays online 24/7 with a real URL.

## Pick your starting point

- [Import from Replit](./tutorials/replit)
- [Import from Lovable](./tutorials/lovable)
- [Import from Bolt](./tutorials/bolt)
- [Import from Emergent](./tutorials/emergent)
- [Import from Google AI Studio](./tutorials/aistudio)
- [Import from GitHub](./tutorials/github)

## What you’ll get

- A live `*.zeabur.app` URL (and you can add a custom domain)
- Proper environment variables for your app (for example, database connection strings)
- Optional managed services (databases, storage, etc.) in the same project

## Common workflow (all guides)

1. Export / download your project source code.
2. Open it locally in VS Code or Cursor and verify it runs.
3. Deploy to Zeabur (via Deploy Button, an editor extension, or Git).
4. Add required services (like a database) and wire them up using environment variables.

<Callout type="info">
  If your app needs persistence, deploy the database on Zeabur and prefer **Internal/Private** connection strings for deployed apps (faster and avoids public bandwidth).
</Callout>

## Before you start

- A Zeabur account
- A local editor (VS Code or Cursor)
- Local runtime tooling for your stack (each guide lists the specific prerequisites)
