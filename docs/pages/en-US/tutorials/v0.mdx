## How to Deploy Your v0 Project to the Web with Zeabur

This guide is the easiest way to take the code generated by **v0** and turn it into a real, live website that you can share with friends or customers.

### Overview

**v0** is amazing for creating your app's design and features, but to put it online, you need "hosting." We strongly recommend **Zeabur** because it handles the technical heavy lifting for you. It takes your code and puts it on a live URL in just a few clicks.

**The Workflow:**

- **Create:** Generate your app in **v0**.
- **Refine:** Save the code to your computer and check it with **Cursor**.
- **Deploy:** Host it live on **Zeabur**.

> 📝 Important Note: This guide focuses on getting your website online (the Frontend). If your app needs to save user data or logins, that requires a Database. We will cover how to add a database in a separate, follow-up tutorial!

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) installed on your computer.
- A [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/) account.
- Node.js installed locally (Version 18+ recommended).

## Step 1: Sync v0 to GitHub

Instead of copying code manually, v0 has a direct integration that creates a GitHub repository for you.

1. **Locate the GitHub Integration:**
   - Open your project in the v0 editor.
   - Look at the top-right header.
   ![Go to GitHub](https://cdn.zeabur.com/v0%20migration/v0%20github%20part%201.png)
   - Click the **"Add to Codebase"** or **GitHub icon** button.

2. **Connect to GitHub:**
   - A menu will appear. Select **"Connect to GitHub"**.
   - Follow the authorization prompts if you haven't connected before.

3. **Create the Repository:**
   - Choose **"Create New Repository"**.
   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., `my-v0-app`).
   - Click **"Create"**.
   - Once finished, you will see a success message with a link to your new GitHub repository. **Copy this URL.**

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Ensure the branch you want to work with (typically `main`) is selected as the active branch.

   - Click **"Push to GitHub"** to push your code to GitHub.
   


## Step 2: Set Up Local Environment (Cursor)

Now you will bring the code from GitHub to your local computer to verify dependencies and make production adjustments.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open **Cursor**.
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) to open the Command Palette.
   - Type `Git: Clone` and select it.
   - Paste the GitHub URL you just copied and choose a folder on your computer to save it.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open the terminal in Cursor (`Ctrl + ~`).
   - Run the install command (v0 projects usually use `npm`):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   - Locate the `.env.example` file (if it exists) and duplicate it to create a `.env` file.
   - **Important:** If your v0 app used API keys (OpenAI, Supabase, etc.), you must manually add these keys to your local `.env` file. v0 does not export your secrets to GitHub for security reasons.

4. **Local Test:**
   Run the development server to ensure the app works locally.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Step 3: Open in a Local Editor and Install the Zeabur Extension

To make deployment incredibly simple, you'll use the Zeabur extension.

1. Go to the Extensions Marketplace in your editor.
2. Search for "Zeabur" and click **Install**.

## Step 4: Deploy with a Single Click

Now that your project folder is open in Cursor:

1. Click on the new **Zeabur icon** (usually a "Z" logo) in the activity bar on the far left.
2. Click the **"Deploy"** button.
3. Your editor will ask for permission to open a link in your browser. Click **"Open"**.

## Step 5: Let the Zeabur AI Agent Handle the Rest

Once you're redirected to Zeabur, the platform's AI agent takes over. It analyzes your code to understand the project's structure, dependencies, and build requirements.

The Zeabur agent will:

- Recognize that you have a full-stack application (e.g., Next.js).
- Automatically configure the build and start commands.
- Provision all necessary services.

![Zeabur Agent Handle the rest](https://cdn.zeabur.com/new%20agent.png)

You'll be prompted to select a project and a deployment region. After that, Zeabur handles everything else.

You can watch in real-time as your service builds and becomes fully operational. Zeabur even provides you with a live domain as soon as the deployment is successful.

## Step 6: Domain & Networking

1. Click on your Service in Zeabur.
2. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.
3. Click **Generate Domain** (to get a `.zeabur.app` domain) or **Custom Domain** to connect your own.
4. Visit the URL. Your v0 application is now a fully deployed production app.

## Step 7: Connect a Database (Supabase)

If your Lovable app allows users to log in, create accounts, or save data, it requires a database (usually **Supabase**).

Currently, you have successfully deployed the **Frontend** (the visual interface). To make the data and authentication features work, you need to connect the backend by adding your API keys to Zeabur's **Variable** settings.

We have a dedicated guide to walk you through getting your Supabase keys and adding them to Zeabur:

That's it! You've successfully moved your project from a prototype on v0 to a live, production-ready application on Zeabur without writing a single line of configuration. This seamless workflow lets you focus on what matters most: building great software.
