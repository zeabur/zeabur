## How to Deploy a GitHub Repository with Zeabur

This guide is the easiest way to take a project that lives on **GitHub** and turn it into a real, live website or API that you can share with users.

### Overview

GitHub is where your code lives, but to put it online you need "hosting." We recommend **Zeabur** because it handles the technical heavy lifting for you. It analyzes your repo, builds it, runs it, and gives you a shareable URL in just a few clicks.

**The Workflow:**

- **Prepare:** Make sure your repo runs locally and has the right config (ports, env vars).
- **Deploy:** Deploy it to **Zeabur** (fastest via the Zeabur extension in Cursor / VS Code).
- **Go live:** Generate a domain and (optionally) add a database or other services.

> 📝 Important Note: If your app uses secrets (API keys, database URLs, etc.), do not commit them to GitHub. Put them in a local `.env` file for development and add them as Zeabur **Variables** after deployment.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (and access to the repository you want to deploy).
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) or VS Code installed on your computer.
- A [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/) account.
- Node.js installed locally (Version 18+ recommended) **or** the runtime your project needs (Python/Go/etc.).

### **Migration Overview**

This plan moves you from "code in a repo" to "a deployed service" with minimal setup.

- **Source:** GitHub Repository
- **Editor:** Cursor / VS Code
- **Host:** Zeabur

### Step 1: Create a New Project

From the main Zeabur dashboard:

1. Click the purple **New Project** button in the top right corner.
2. Select your preferred region (e.g., AWS Taipei, as seen in your settings) if prompted, or it will default to your standard region.

### Step 2: Select Deployment Source

Once the project environment is created, a modal will appear asking "What do you want to deploy?".

1. Click on **GitHub** (Deploy from GitHub repo).
    - *Note:* Since your code is already pushed to GitHub, this is the correct path.

### Step 3: Connect and Select Repository

1. **Search:** In the search bar, type the name of the repository you created (e.g., `cnynewyrdishes` or whatever you named your repo).
2. **Select:** Click on the specific repository from the list.
    - *Tip:* If you do not see your repository listed, click the **Configure GitHub** button to ensure Zeabur has permission to access that specific repository in your GitHub account.

### Step 4: Review Build Configuration

Zeabur will automatically analyze your code to determine the language and framework (e.g., in your screenshot, it detected `Node.js` and `Vite`).

1. Review the **Build Plan Preview**.
2. Ensure the **Install Command** (e.g., `yarn install`) and **Build Command** (e.g., `yarn build`) look correct for your project.
3. Click the purple **Deploy** button at the bottom right.

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

Zeabur will now pull your code, install dependencies, and build the project.

1. You will see the status change from "Building" to **Running**.
2. Once the indicator light turns green (as seen in the final screenshot), your service is active.

### Step 6: Expose Your Website (Add Domain)

Right now, your app is running, but it isn't accessible to the public yet. You need to generate a URL.

1. On the service overview page (the last screenshot), look for the **Add Domain** button or tab.
2. Click **Add Domain**.
3. You can either:
    - **Generate a zeabur.app domain:** This gives you a free URL (e.g., `cnynewyrdishes.zeabur.app`).
    - **Custom Domain:** Connect your own domain if you own one.
4. Once added, click the link to visit your live site!
