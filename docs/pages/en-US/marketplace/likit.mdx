### Step 4: Deploy from prebuilt marketplace

After deploying Postgres and Redis, you can deploy Likit.

Go to the "Prebuilt" section in the marketplace. You will find Likit in the list.

### Step 5: Bind a domain

While you are waiting for the service to start and become operational, you can bind a domain to it. 
This domain can be your own or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

Open the "Domain" tab on the service page and click on "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](/deploy/domain-binding).

### Step 6: Start using Likit

After binding the domain, you can click on the domain to enter the Likit dashboard and get started.
