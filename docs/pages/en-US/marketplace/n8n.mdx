# Deploy n8n

[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

This article will show you how to deploy n8n with PostgreSQL on Zeabur.

## Deploy n8n from template

Since n8n requires PostgreSQL as a database, you can not deploy it directly from the image.

We have made a template for you to deploy n8n with PostgreSQL in one click.

### Step 1: Open n8n template page

First of all, visit [the template page](https://zeabur.com/templates/W2H4RW) for n8n.

You can see that the template is already configured with PostgreSQL service, so you don't need to do anything.

### Step 2: Deploy template

Click on the Deploy button, and then select a region to deploy your services.

After the selection, you will be automatically redirected to the project page where you can see the deployment progress.

Wait a few more seconds, and your n8n service will be deployed successfully and start running.

### Step 3: Bind domain

You need to bind a domain to access your n8n service after the deployment.

You can follow [the guide to bind a domain](/deploy/domain-binding) for more details.

### Step 4: Setup Account

After the deployment is complete, you can access your n8n service through the domain name you bound.

You will see a page like this:

Follow the instructions on the page to set up your n8n account. After the setup is complete, you can use n8n normally.
