# Deploying with Dockerfile

Normally, you don't need to write a `Dockerfile` by yourself. Zeabur currently provides fast deployment methods for various popular frameworks, but if your project is not using these frameworks or you want to define your own deployment method, you can use a `Dockerfile` to deploy it.

## Creating a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` or `dockerfile` in the root directory of your project and write your deployment method in it. Finally, make sure you have exposed the corresponding `PORT`.

Zeabur will automatically detect if your project has a `Dockerfile`. If so, it will deploy your project using Docker.

<Callout type="info">
  After the deployment starts, you can see the Docker icon above, which means your project has been deployed using Docker.
</Callout>

## Deploying without using Dockerfile

If your project has a Dockerfile but you do not want to use this Dockerfile on Zeabur (for example, letting Zeabur decide the best deployment method of this project), you can set `ZBPACK_IGNORE_DOCKERFILE=true` in the environment variables, or add the following to `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
  "ignore_dockerfile": true
}
```

Zeabur will then ignore your Dockerfile and automatically determine the deployment method.

## Environment Variables

If your `Dockerfile` needs to use environment variables, you can click **Environment Variables** on the service page to add them. For more settings, please refer to [Environment Variables](/en-US/environment/variables).

If your `Dockerfile` is written in one stage, or if your environment variables only need to be used in the final stage, you don't need to manually write `ENV`. Zeabur will automatically add it for you.

### ARG

However, if your `Dockerfile` is written in multiple stages ([multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)), and you need to set environment variables before building, you can use `ARG` to set them.

Here, we take nodejs and nginx as an example to write a `Dockerfile` for deployment.

```docker {7-8} copy
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

## The `BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE` here will be set before building automatically
ARG BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE
ENV BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE=${BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE}

RUN npm install && \
    npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/configfile.template
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

ENV \
    PORT=8080 \
    HOST=0.0.0.0

EXPOSE 8080

CMD sh -c "envsubst '\$PORT' < /etc/nginx/conf.d/configfile.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
```

## Specifying Dockerfile to Deploy

To deploy a project using a specified Dockerfile, name the Dockerfile as `[service-name].Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.[service-name]`. For instance, if you have a `Dockerfile.storage` file in your project and your service name is `storage`, Zeabur will deploy the `storage` service using this Dockerfile.

![specify-service-name](/deploy/dockerfile/specify-service-name.png)

You can also specify the `ZBPACK_DOCKERFILE_NAME` environment variable or add the following to `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
  "dockerfile": {
    "name": "storage"
  }
}
```

For example, if you set `ZBPACK_DOCKERFILE_NAME=storage` in your service, Zeabur will use `Dockerfile.storage` as the Dockerfile to deploy the `storage` service.

## Docker Compose

Zeabur currently does not support deploying from Docker Compose YAML.

You can convert your Docker Compose file into a Zeabur Template YAML. For details, see [Creating Templates from YAML](/template/template-in-code). If you need assistance, feel free to contact us at [community](/community/help).
