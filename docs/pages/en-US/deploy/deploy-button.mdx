# Deploy Button

With our deploy button, it is easy to deploy services to Zeabur with one click. The button can be used in any markdown file or html file. It can transform any [Zeabur template](https://zeabur.com/templates) into a deployable project.

## What is a Deploy Button

The deploy button is a simple html code snippet. You can copy the snippet and paste into any markdown file or html file. Each button will redirect users to a desired template. The template can be a single service or a group of services decided by the template author.

Buttons can also end with authors' referral code, each new users who signed up with the referral code upgrades to a paid plan, the author will get a US$ 5 credits.

## Copy the Button

As the button is connected to a template, only the template author can generate the button.

To copy the button, you need to go to the account page in [Zeabur Dashboard](https://zeabur.com/account), select **Template** tab, and you can see a list of templates you have created.
