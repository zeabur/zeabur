# Setting Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure your application.
Zeabur provides a way to set environment variables for your service.

## Add, Edit, Delete

You can set environment variables in the **Variables** tab of your service, and you can **Add Variables** to your service.

![environment variables](/environment/add-variables.png)

Zeabur will automatically inject these environment variables into your service.

- `<YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_HOST`：The host of the service.

- `PORT`：The port of the service

- Other variables like database credentials([PostgreSQL](https://zeabur.com/templates/B20CX0)) or [Redis](https://zeabur.com/templates/KQZHXT) connection string and so on.

And you don't need to set the environment variables manually.

When hovering over a variable, you can choose to start editing or delete the variable.

## Edit as Raw

If you want to add multiple variables at once, you can use the batch editing function.

Click the **Edit as Raw** button to enter the batch editing mode, which will set the service environment variables in `.env` file.

## Variable Reference

Zeabur allows you to reference other variables using a simple template syntax. Here's how you can do it:

1. Use the template syntax to reference other variables directly.
2. When setting a new variable, refer to existing variable names by surrounding them with ${}.

**Example:**

If you have two variables, `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, you can combine their values and set a new variable, `AUTH_INFOR`, like this:

```bash
# For example, you can set the variable like this:
AUTH_INFOR=${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}
```

![reference](/environment/var-reference.png)

By doing this, the value of `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` will be automatically combined and injected into `AUTH_INFOR`.

## Special Variables

"Special Variables" are environment variables that are predefined by Zeabur and can be directly used.

### Referencing

- In the environment variable input box in Zeabur: Use the `${VARIABLE}` format to insert special variables.
- In your own application: Use the same method as referencing an environment variables (`process.env.VARIABLE`).

### Variable Priority Order

The order of expansion for variables within a service is as follows:

- Environment variables defined by the current service will be obtained first.
- If not defined, environment variables exposed by other services will be obtained.
- If not defined, special variables will be obtained.

### Variables

#### Hostname/Port

- `${ZEABUR_[PORTNAME]_URL}`: The URL corresponding to a specific port.
  - For example, `https://test.zeabur.app`.
  - This URL is that one you set in the "Domain" section:

    ![Domain Port Customization](/deploy/special-variables/domain-port-customization.png)

  - For services deployed from Git repositories, the `PORTNAME` is always `web`.
- `${ZEABUR_[PORTNAME]_DOMAIN}`: The domain corresponding to a specific port.
  - For example, `test.zeabur.app`.
  - This URL is that one you set in the "Domain" section.
  - For services deployed from Git repositories, the `PORTNAME` is always `web`.
- `${CONTAINER_HOSTNAME}`: The hostname of the current service in the Zeabur project.
    - Usually, we create an environment variable with the Expose property (e.g., `${MYSQL_HOST}`),
      and then fill in the value of `${CONTAINER_HOSTNAME}` in this environment variable.
    - However, if you want to reference the hostname of another service within Zeabur, we recommend using the DNS feature that Zeabur will release in the future.
- `${[PORTNAME]_PORT}`: The port defined in the Prebuilt service.
    - For example, if you set `database / 3306 / TCP`, then `DATABASE_PORT` will be `3306`.
    - Only visible within the current service.
    - For services deployed from Git repositories, it is `8080`. You can read this port from `${PORT}`.

#### Zeabur Information

These variables are not commonly used, but if you need the unique identifiers of the current Zeabur service/project,
these variables will be very helpful.

- `${ZEABUR_SERVICE_ID}`: Service ID
- `${ZEABUR_PROJECT_ID}`: Project ID
- `${ZEABUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID}`: Service environment ID
- `${ZEABUR_USER_ID}`: User ID who created this project

#### Git Information

These variables will only appear during the build phase of the Git service.

- `${ZEABUR_GIT_COMMIT_SHA}`: The Git commit SHA value that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_AUTHOR}`: The Git commit author ID that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_BRANCH}`: The Git branch name that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_REPO_NAME}`: The Git repository name that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_REPO_OWNER}`: The Git repository owner ID that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE}`: The Git commit message that the current deployment belongs to.

#### Utilities

- `${PASSWORD}`: A random password generated by Zeabur for each service.
