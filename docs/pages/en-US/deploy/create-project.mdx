# Create Project

To deploy services on Zeabur, you need to create a project first. 

You can follow the steps below to create a project.

## What is a project

A project is a collection of services that are deployed together, services in the same project can communicate with each other with internal network.
You can create multiple projects in different regions and deploy kinds of services in each project.

Besides, you can [set the budget and manage the usages](../manage/budget) for project, [invite other team members](../manage/invite) to manage the services and so on.

## How to create a project

First, you need to navigate to the [dashboard's projects page](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects).

If you are new to Zeabur without any project, you will see an onboarding page to create your first project.

and then select the region where you want to create the project, the project will be automatically created with a random name.
