# Export Project

Zeabur can export deployment information of a project, such as Docker images, Git repositories, environment variables, volumes, etc., into a YAML file. This makes it easy for you to import into other projects for one-click project duplication or to publish to Zeabur's [Template Catalog](https://zeabur.com/templates) for easy sharing with Zeabur community.

    Note that "Export Project" **does not include data**. For information on data backup and restoration, please refer to the documentation, [Backup Service](/data-management/backup) and [Restore Backup](/data-management/restore)
</Callout>

## Export Steps

First, click on "Settings" in the project sidebar, then click the "Export" button under "General".

![project settings](/deploy/export-project/project-settings.webp)

Then, you will see the [Template YAML](/template/template-in-code) structure of your project. You can choose to directly "Copy" or click "Export" to output it as a YAML file.

![export project to template](/deploy/export-project/export-project-to-template.webp)

## Import into Project

Currently, Zeabur only supports importing the template YAML into a project using the [CLI](https://github.com/zeabur/cli).

First, you should have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) toolchain installed, then use `npx` to start the Zeabur CLI:

```bash
npx zeabur@latest template deploy -f <path to exported YAML file>
```

This command will prompt you to deploy to a specific project (or guide you to create a new project).

Note that you may be prompted to log in, so please follow the instructions to log into your Zeabur account.

## Publish to Template Catalog

You will need to make adjustments to the template content (such as `description`, `icon`, `readme`, etc.). Please refer to the instructions on [Creating a Template from YAML](/template/template-in-code) to update your template and then use the CLI to publish it.
