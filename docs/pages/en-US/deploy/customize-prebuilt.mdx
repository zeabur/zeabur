# Custom Docker image

While Zeabur already includes numerous templates provided by the community, you might need to deploy your own Docker images, configure persistent storage, set start command, and more. For this need, Zeabur offers customizable Prebuilt functionality.

## Configuration Instructions

### Image

![Image Configuration Instructions](/deploy/customize-prebuilt/select-image.webp)

"Image" is the Docker image to be pulled, typically the image tag following `docker pull` or `docker run`, such as

```bash
docker pull mariadb      # tag is "mariadb"
docker run mariadb:lts   # tag is "mariadb:lts"
```

Or in Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres      # tag is "postgres"
    # ...
```

After setting up, you can proceed to configure environment variables, ports, etc.

### Environment Variable

![Environment Variable Configuration Example](/deploy/customize-prebuilt/environment-variable.webp)

"Environment Variable," as the name implies, is the environment variable passed to the service. In addition to basic environment variable settings, Zeabur also allows you to expose these variables to other services.

"Key" is the environment variable key, allowing only letters, numbers, and underscores, such as `MARIADB_USER` or `DB_1_HOST`.

"Value" is the environment variable value, which can include `${KEY}` references to other variables. As shown above, `MARIADB_PASSWORD` references `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD`, so its value equals `123456`. Likewise, if a variable value is `password=${MARIADB_PASSWORD}`, it expands to `password=123456`. This `${KEY}` format expands at service startup, so the application sees the expanded value.

"Expose" makes the variable available to other services. For instance, `MARIADB_USERNAME` and `MARIADB_PASSWORD` are exposed, making them accessible to other services in the same project.

Aside from variables Exposed by other services, you can also use [Zeabur's predefined special variables](/deploy/special-variables), such as using `${ZEABUR_WEB_URL}` to retrieve the URL set on the `web` port.

If you are write a Prebuilt according to a Docker image documentation, environment variables often follow `docker run` with `--env` (or `-e`), such as:

```bash
docker run --detach --name some-mariadb --env MARIADB_USER=example-user --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=my_cool_secret --env MARIADB_DATABASE=example-database --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw  mariadb:latest

# MARIADB_USER          = example-user
# MARIADB_PASSWORD      = my_cool_secret
# MARIADB_DATABASE      = example-database
# MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD = my-secret-pw
```

In Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    environment:
      DEBUG: "true"   # (or) - DEBUG=true
      # DEBUG = true
```

### Ports

![Ports Configuration Example](/deploy/customize-prebuilt/ports.webp)

"Ports" function like firewall inbound rules, allowing only declared ports to be accessed by other services or the external network.

"Port Name" should consist only of letters and dashes. "Port" is the service listening port, such as `3306` for MariaDB or `8080`, `3000`, `80` for web services.

"Port Type" can be `HTTP` or `TCP`. For external access, `HTTP` ports can be accessed with a domain (e.g., `my-service.zeabur.app`) that contains the automatic TLS certificate signing by Zeabur, while `TCP` ports can be accessed with an auto-assigned hostname and port (e.g., `reg.clusters.zeabur.com:12345`). For inter-service connections, you can access the port with [Private Networking](/deploy/private-networking), which reduces unnecessary traffic costs. To access this port in other services, use the declared port directly (`mariadb.zeabur.internal:3306`, `backend.zeabur.internal:8080`).

If you are write a Prebuilt according to a Docker image documentation, ports follow `docker run` with `-p`, such as:

```bash
docker run -p 3306 mariadb:latest

# Port Name = <Custom>; Port = 3306; Port Type = TCP
# TCP because MariaDB uses a custom TCP-based protocol.
```

In Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:8080
      # Port Name = <Custom>; Port = 8080; Port Type = HTTP
      # HTTP because adminer is a PHP web interface for database management.
```

### Volumes

![Volumes Configuration Example](/deploy/customize-prebuilt/volumes.webp)

"Volumes" are paths for persistent storage.

By default, Zeabur resets the service data to the image's default state upon each restart (stateless). To store data long-term in a container, you can configure persistent storage and mount it to the desired directory. This ensures that the mounted directory remains unchanged on restarts or updates, until you delete the service or modify the directory contents. The "Backup" feature also backs up this space. Refer to [Zeabur Pricing](https://zeabur.com/pricing) for persistent storage charges.

"Volume id" is the storage space identifier, consisting only of letters, numbers, and dashes. "Path" is the mount path, configured according to the Docker image's **Volume** settings.

In Docker image documentation, volumes follow `docker run` with `-v`, such as:

```bash
docker run -v your-storage:/var/lib/mysql mariadb:latest

# Volume ID = <Custom>; Path = /var/lib/mysql
```

In Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
    volumes:
      - your-storage:/var/lib/mysql
      # Volume ID = <Custom>; Path = /var/lib/mysql
```

### Start Command

![Start Command Configuration Example](/deploy/customize-prebuilt/start-command.webp)

"Start Command" allows you to override the default Docker image entrypoint and arguments. This is an advanced setting and can be skipped if you are unsure what it is.

When specifying from the GUI, the default entrypoint when setting this field is `/bin/sh`. If your image does not provide `/bin/sh`, use **Edit TOML** to change it or consult [support](/community/help) for assistant.

## Manually Write Your Template

Although the GUI offers many necessary parameters for creating your Docker services, you might want to add custom icons, connection instructions, or detailed settings. In this case, [writing your template in code](/deploy/template-in-code) is a better choice.

If you have any questions about writing your own template, feel free to contact [support](/community/help).
