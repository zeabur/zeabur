# Referral Rewards

<Callout>
We've updated the referral program! Don't worry — the old system is still active and both can run simultaneously.
We plan to fully integrate the old and new systems in Q2 2026. Start sharing your referral code now to enjoy even more rewards!

Zeabur offers a referral reward system for all users. Share your referral code with friends — when they use it at checkout, they get a discount and you earn a commission.

## How It Works

1. **Share your referral code**: Find your referral code on the [Referral](https://zeabur.com/account/referral) page and share it with friends.
2. **Friend enters code at checkout**: When your friend purchases a Dedicated Server or tops up AI Hub balance, they can enter your referral code on the checkout page to receive a discount.
3. **Both benefit**: Your friend gets a one-time discount on their purchase, and you receive a commission deposited into your commission wallet.

## Referral Challenge (Lv1–Lv5)

The referral system features a 5-level tier system. The more people you successfully refer, the higher your level — and the more powerful your referral code becomes.

| Level | Revenue Threshold | Friend's Discount | Your Commission |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Lv1   | $0+               | 10%               | 20%             |
| Lv2   | $100+             | 20%               | 40%             |
| Lv3   | $500+             | 30%               | 60%             |
| Lv4   | $1,000+           | 40%               | 80%             |
| Lv5   | $5,000+           | 50%               | 100%            |

- **Revenue Threshold**: The total amount your referees have spent (before discounts). When the total reaches a threshold, you level up.
- **Friend's Discount**: The one-time discount your friend receives on their first purchase.
- **Your Commission**: The percentage of the original purchase amount you earn as commission.

## Share Your Referral Code

Go to the [Referral](https://zeabur.com/account/referral) page in your dashboard. You will see your personal referral code, which you can copy and share via social media, email, or any other way you like.

You can also customize your referral code on this page.

## Commission Wallet

The commissions you earn are deposited into your commission wallet. You can view your wallet balance and convert it to Zeabur account credits at any time on the [Referral](https://zeabur.com/account/referral) page.

- **Balance**: The total commissions you have earned but not yet converted.
- **Convert to Credits**: Convert your wallet balance to Zeabur account credits, which will be used to pay for your subscriptions and usage with the highest priority.
- **Conversion History**: View your past conversions on the same page.

## Referral History

On the [Referral](https://zeabur.com/account/referral) page, you can see a detailed history of all your referral commissions, including each referee's information, the product they purchased, the commission amount, and the date.

## Rules

- Each user can only use a referral code **once** in their lifetime. The discount applies to a single purchase of either a **Dedicated Server** or an **AI Hub** top-up.
- Referral codes can only be used by new users who have not previously purchased a Dedicated Server (for server purchases) or topped up AI Hub (for AI Hub top-ups).
- The referrer must have active projects on Zeabur.
- Commissions are credited only after the referee has a confirmed payment history.
- Legacy referral records from the old system are counted toward your level progression.
