# Community Forum

The [Zeabur Community Forum](https://zeabur.com/forum) is the official hub for users to discuss, ask questions, and receive help related to Zeabur. Whether you are experiencing a service issue, need phone verification, or have a billing question, the forum is the place to go.

## Support Priority

We strive to provide help for everyone. To ensure the best experience, we prioritize support based on your plan:

| Plan | Expected Response Time |
| --- | --- |
| Team Plan | Within 12 hours |
| Dev Plan | Within 3 working days |
| Free Plan | Within 5 working days |

To help us resolve your issue as quickly as possible, please provide as much information as you can when creating a post. The more details you include, the fewer follow-up questions we need to ask.

<Callout type="info">
  If you are a **Team plan** user, we will create a private group chat in your most commonly used messaging application (e.g., Discord, WhatsApp). You can ask all your questions directly in that private channel instead of posting on the forum — this gives you more privacy, a more intuitive support experience, and helps our staff understand your context faster.

#### Service Issue

Select either the **Project** or **Server** tab:

- **Project tab**: Select your **Project** and **Service** from the dropdowns. This is required so we can locate your deployment.
- **Server tab**: Select your **Server** from the dropdown if the issue is related to a specific server.

You can also paste an **Error Message** (optional). If you see an error toast in the bottom-right corner of the Zeabur dashboard, click the copy button on the toast and paste the error message into this field.

#### Phone Verification

- **Country / Region**: Select your country or region.
- **Phone Number**: Enter the phone number you would like to verify.

<Callout>
  Phone Verification posts are private and will only be visible to you and Zeabur staff. This ensures your personal information stays protected while giving our team the details they need to help you.

Select the **Server**, **Subscription**, or **Balance** tab depending on what you are requesting a refund for:

- **Server tab**: Select your **Server** and a **Reason** for the refund.
- **Subscription tab**: Select a **Reason** for the refund.
- **Balance tab**: Select a **Reason** for the refund.

### Content

Describe your issue in detail using the rich text editor. You can format your text with headings, lists, code blocks, links, and more.

**Tips for writing a good post:**

- Describe what you were trying to do and what happened instead.
- Include the steps to reproduce the problem.
- Mention any changes you made before the issue started.
- Paste relevant logs or error messages.
- Attach screenshots or files by dropping or pasting them into the editor.

The more descriptive you are, the faster we can help you without asking redundant questions.
