# Verify Your Account

Verifying your account links your Zeabur account with Discord, so you can discuss and engage with the community more easily.

You may also get some credits as a reward for your activity in our Discord server.

## How to Get Verified

We use our Discord bot **Zebra** to help us with the verification process.

### Step 1: Join Our Discord Server

First of all, you need to [join our Discord server](https://zeabur.com/dc). You can communicate with our staff and other users there, and post your feedbacks and problems.

### Step 2: Link Your Account

When you get into our Discord server, you will see a welcome message from Zebra. You will find a [verify channel](https://discord.com/channels/1060209568820494336/1095916895649153094) in the message content.

Click on the verify button, you will see a authorization page from Discord. Click on the **Authorize** button to link your Discord account with our website.

When you get redirected to our website, you will see a success message in the toaster, and you can close the website.

## What's Next

After verification, you can participate in discussions on our Discord server. When you upgrade to another plan, **Zebra** will automatically give you a special role in our Discord server. You can join exclusive channels with that role.
