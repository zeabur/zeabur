# **Get Help**

Sometimes you may encounter problems when using Zeabur. You can get help from the Zeabur team through the following channels.

## Community Forum

The [Zeabur Community Forum](https://zeabur.com/forum) is the primary place to get help. You can create a post describing your issue and our team will respond based on your plan's support priority. See the [Community Forum](./forum) page for details on how to create a post and what to include.

## Discord

You can also join [our official Discord Server](https://zeabur.com/dc) to discuss with other users and the Zeabur team.

<Callout>
  Discord is a community discussion platform. While Zeabur staff may participate and answer questions, we are not responsible for responding to all messages there. For official support with guaranteed response times, please use the [Community Forum](./forum) instead.
