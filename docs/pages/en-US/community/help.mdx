# Get Help

Sometimes you may encounter some problems when using Zeabur. You can get help from the Zeabur team through the following channels.

## Community Forum

The [Zeabur Community Forum](https://zeabur.com/forum) is the primary place to get help. You can create a post describing your issue and our team will respond based on your plan's support priority. See the [Community Forum](./forum) page for details on how to create a post and what to include.

## Discord

You can also join [our official Discord Server](https://zeabur.com/dc) to discuss with other users and the Zeabur team.

<Callout>
  Discord is a community discussion platform. While Zeabur staff may participate and answer questions, we are not responsible for responding to all messages there. For official support with guaranteed response times, please use the [Community Forum](./forum) instead.

## Upgrading Your Plan

If you need faster response times and dedicated support, consider upgrading your plan. Higher-tier plans come with shorter guaranteed response times on the [Community Forum](./forum). See the [Plans](../billing/plans) page for more details.

## Email

You can also reach out to us via email for support or inquiries:

- **Email:** [contact@zeabur.com](mailto:contact@zeabur.com)

For faster response times, we recommend using the [Community Forum](./forum). However, if you prefer email communication, feel free to send us a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
