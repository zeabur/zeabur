# Deploy Vapor Project

[Vapor](https://vapor.codes) is a well-known Web framework in Swift ecosystem. With the help of Vapor, you can use Swift to develop a Web application based on Http.

This article will introduce how to deploy your Vapor project to Zeabur.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure your computer is ready for Swift and Vapor development environment:


```bash
brew install vapor
```

## Create Vapor Project

There are two ways to create Vapor projects:

### Use Vapor Command Tool

```bash
vapor new <project-name>
cd <project-name>
vapor xcode
```

The project created by Vapor command has `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` by default. The good news is that you can deploy it directly on Zeabur without Dockerfile, so you can delete these two files directly:

```bash
rm Dockerfile docker-compose.yml
```

### Use Zeabur Template

Open https://github.com/zeabur/vapor-template , click `Use this template` button, enter the project name, and then click `Create repository from template` button.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-name>
vapor xcode
```

## Development

During development, you can run the project directly on your local machine:

```bash
vapor run
```

Next, modify the Swift code according to your needs.

## Deployment

First, make sure that all your changes have been synchronized to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push
```

Next, go to [Zeabur Console](https://dash.zeabur.com) and create a new project.

Then, click the `Deploy New Service` button and select deploy from GitHub.

    If you are deploying a project from GitHub for the first time on Zeabur, you need to configure and install GitHub App first.
    You can view more detailed guides [here](/deploy/github).

After you select the repository and branch, Zeabur will automatically start building your service.

Zeabur will automatically detect that your service is built by Vapor, so you don't need to do any additional configuration. Your deployment will be completed in a few minutes.

## Next

After the deployment is completed, you may need to configure the domain for your Vapor website.

Open the "Domain" tab of the service page, and then click "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information on how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Domain Binding](/deploy/domain-binding).
