# Deploying PHP apps

Zeabur supports not only traditional multi-file PHP application with `index.php` as the entry point but also one-click deployment of frameworks such as [Laravel](./php/laravel), [Symfony](./php/symfony), ThinkPHP, and CodeIgniter.

## PHP Environment

Zeabur uses the latest version of PHP 8 by default and an NGINX + php-fpm server to run your code.

The PHP environment in Zeabur comes with built-in Composer and PHP extensions like `apcu`, `bcmath`, `gd`, `intl`, `mysqli`, `opcache`, `pcntl`, `pdo_mysql`, `sysvsem`, and `zip`. If your `composer.json` includes other `ext-` prefixed extension definitions, Zeabur will automatically install the corresponding extensions. Additionally, tools like Node.js, Crontab, cURL, gettext, Git, grep, pkg-config, and unzip are pre-installed.

By default, Zeabur provides the environment variables `APP_ENV=prod` and `APP_DEBUG=true` to your application. You can manually override these variables in the "Environment Variables" section of the Zeabur console.

For the complete base image configuration, check out the [zbpack code repository](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/blob/main/internal/php/Dockerfile).

## NPM Support

If your project has a `package.json` file, Zeabur will automatically run `npm install` to install dependencies.

If your `package.json` contains a `build` script, Zeabur will also run `npm run build` to generate build artifacts.

## Custom Build and Start Commands

Zeabur allows you to customize the build and start commands for PHP using environment variables or configuration files.

### Build Command

The "build command" is ideal for scenarios where you need to download or compile custom artifacts (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) or configure settings. For instance, to write a configuration file to the `/etc` directory, you can set an environment variable:

```env
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=echo 'your-configuration' > /etc/somewhere
```

Or, you can add the following in `zbpack.json`:

```json filename="zbpack.json"
{
    "build_command": "echo 'your-configuration' > /etc/somewhere"
}
```

You can also run additional npm commands here:

```json filename="zbpack.json"
{
    "build_command": "npm run build:dist"
}
```

The build command **will not** interfere with Zeabur’s default build process, so there’s no need to repeat commands that Zeabur already handles.

### Start Command

The "start command" is suitable for situations where you want to execute commands while starting the PHP server, such as running `php artisan migrate` to create database tables. For example, you can set an environment variable:

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="php artisan migrate && _startup"
```

Or add the following in `zbpack.json`:

```json filename="zbpack.json"
{
    "start_command": "php artisan migrate && _startup"
}
```

Note: If you need a service to run continuously, place the start command in `()` and use `&` to run the task in the background.

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="(php artisan reverb:start &); _startup"
```

Or:

```json filename="zbpack.json"
{
    "start_command": "(php artisan reverb:start &); _startup"
}
```

Here, `_startup` is Zeabur's default startup command ([refer to zbpack](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/tree/main/internal/php)). If you customize the `start_command`, you must include `_startup` in the command; otherwise, the PHP server will not start.

Both `build_command` and `start_command` are executed using a POSIX-compatible shell, so you can chain multiple commands with `&&` or separate them with `;`.

### Handling Complex Start Commands

If your start command is complex (such as involving the setup of scheduled tasks, starting multiple services, etc.), `start_command` may become too complicated and difficult to debug. You can try packaging these commands into a script using the [Config Editor](/data-management/config-edit), such as `worker.sh`:

```bash filename="worker.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

php artisan migrate
php artisan queue:work &
# And your various commands
```

Then execute this script in the `start_command`:

```json filename="zbpack.json"
{
    "start_command": "(bash worker.sh &); _startup"
}
```

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND=(bash worker.sh &); _startup
```

### Handling of Workers

For queue processing or scheduled tasks, we recommend handling services separately.

If you want to start a queue worker, you can deploy another service `queue-worker` outside of the main service, where the `start_command` is:

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="php artisan queue:work"
```

Do not add `; _startup` so that the PHP server does not start. This way, you will have a separate service dedicated to handling asynchronous tasks.

If you also need a service to handle scheduled tasks, you can deploy another service `cron-worker`, where the `start_command` is:

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="php artisan schedule:work"
```

In this way, even if one of your workers encounters a problem, the other workers and the main service will not be affected.

## Custom PHP Version

Zeabur uses PHP 8 by default, but you can specify the PHP version through `composer.json` or zbpack configuration. If your project uses Laravel Sail, Zeabur can automatically detect the PHP version from `docker-compose.yml`. The priority order is: zbpack configuration > `composer.json` > Laravel Sail.

### `composer.json`

Set the PHP version range in the `require` section of `composer.json`:

```json filename="composer.json"
{
    "require": {
        "php": "7.4"
    }
}
```

In this example, Zeabur will use the latest patch version of PHP 7.4 to run your project.

```json filename="composer.json"
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.4"
    }
}
```

Here, Zeabur will use the latest minor version of PHP 7 to run your project.

### Laravel Sail

If your project uses Laravel Sail, Zeabur will automatically detect and use the PHP version defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

![Docker Compose Definition for Laravel Sail](/guides/php/laravel-sail-docker-compose.webp)

### zbpack Configuration

If you’re not using Laravel Sail or Composer but need to specify a PHP version, you can use the `ZBPACK_PHP_VERSION` environment variable:

```env
ZBPACK_PHP_VERSION=8.0
```

Or add the following in `zbpack.json`:

```json filename="zbpack.json"
{
    "php": {
        "version": "8.0"
    }
}
```

## Custom `php.ini` Settings

Using Zeabur’s [configuration file editor](/data-management/config-edit), create a configuration file in the `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d` directory with the `.ini` extension and include the PHP settings you want to override.

For example, to set the maximum upload file size to 100MB, create a file `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/upload.ini` with the following content:

```ini filename="/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/upload.ini"
upload_max_filesize = 100M
```

## Custom NGINX Configuration

Using Zeabur’s [configuration file editor](/data-management/config-edit), create a configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` to override the default NGINX settings in Zeabur. The editor will prefill the current NGINX configuration, which you can modify as needed.

For instance, to disable `gzip` compression, change `gzip_static on;` to `gzip_static off;` in the template.

```nginx filename="/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default" {3}
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    gzip_static off;
}
```
