# Deploying PHP apps

Zeabur supports not only traditional multi-file PHP apps with `index.php` as the entry point but also offers one-click deployment for frameworks like [Laravel](./php/laravel), ThinkPHP, CodeIgniter, etc.

## NPM Support

If your project root contains a `package.json`, Zeabur will automatically install Node.js and NPM for you; if your `package.json` contains a `build` script, Zeabur will automatically run `npm install && npm run build` to build the artifacts.

If you need to change the build commands (e.g., to run `npm run build:dist`), please refer to the section on Customizing Build and Start Commands.

## Customizing Build and Start Commands

Zeabur allows you to customize PHP build and start commands using environment variables or configuration files.

"Build commands" are suitable for scenarios where you need to download or compile custom artifacts (such as CSS, JavaScript, etc.) or write constant configurations. For example, if you want to write settings to the `/etc` folder, you can set an environment variable like this:

```env
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=echo 'your-configuration' > /etc/somewhere
```

Or add the following settings in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "build_command": "echo 'your-configuration' > /etc/somewhere"
}
```

You can also execute npm commands here. Note that Zeabur will only install Node.js and NPM if there is a `package.json` in the **project root directory**. If your project does not contain a `package.json`, `npm` commands will not be available:

```json
{
    "build_command": "npm install && npm run build:dist"
}
```

"Start commands" are suitable for scenarios when you need to run command before starting a PHP server, such as adding `php artisan migrate` to the original command to migrate database. For example, you can set an environment variable like this:

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="php artisan migrate && _startup"
```

Or add the following settings in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "start_command": "php artisan migrate && _startup"
}
```

Here, `_startup` is Zeabur's original start command (which can be found in [the zbpack source code](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/tree/main/internal/php)). If you have a custom `start_command`, `_startup` must be included in your start command; otherwise, the PHP server will not start.

Both `build_command` and `start_command` will be executed using a POSIX-compliant shell, so you can use `&&` to chain multiple commands, or use `;` to separate multiple commands.

## Custom PHP Version

Zeabur defaults to using PHP 8, but you can specify the PHP version using `composer.json` or zbpack settings. If your project uses Laravel Sail, Zeabur will also automatically detect the version based on `docker-compose.yml`. zbpack settings have the highest priority, followed by `composer.json`, and then Laravel Sail.

### `composer.json`

Set the PHP version range in the `require` section of `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "7.4"
    }
}
```

In the example above, Zeabur will use the latest patch version of PHP 7.4 to run your project.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.4"
    }
}
```

In the example above, Zeabur will use the latest minor version of PHP 7 to run your project.

### Laravel Sail

If your project uses Laravel Sail, Zeabur will automatically detect and use the PHP version defined by Laravel Sail in `docker-compose.yml`.

### zbpack Settings

If you are not using Laravel Sail or Composer but need to change the PHP version, you can use the `ZBPACK_PHP_VERSION` environment variable

```env
ZBPACK_PHP_VERSION=8.0
```

Or add the following setting in `zbpack.json`

```json
{
    "php": {
        "version": "8.0"
    }
}
```

to customize the PHP version.

## Customizing `php.ini` Settings

Use Zeabur's [config file editor](/deploy/config-edit) to create a configuration file under `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d` with the extension `ini`. You can directly write the PHP settings you wish to override in this file.

For example, if you want to set the maximum file upload size to 100MB, you can create a file `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/upload.ini` with the following content:

```ini
upload_max_filesize = 100M
```

## Customizing NGINX Configuration

Use Zeabur's [config file editor](/deploy/config-edit) to create a configuration file at the path `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`, which overrides the default NGINX configuration on Zeabur.

If you'd like to tweak the NGINX configuration based on the existing configuration, you can download the current NGINX configuration file used by Zeabur from the [zbpack NGINX configuration repository](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/blob/main/internal/php/nginx-conf/default.conf), and make your modifications on that basis. For example, if you wish to disable `gzip` compression, you can change the template's `gzip_static on;` to `gzip_static off;`.

```
server {
    # see https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/blob/main/internal/php/nginx-conf/default.conf

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        gzip_static off;  // disable gzip compression
	}
}
```
