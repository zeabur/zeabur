# Deploy Python Projects

Zeabur supports various types of Python projects, including:

- [Flask](./python/flask)
- [Django](./python/django)
- FastAPI

If your source code includes `app.py`, `main.py`, or similar entry points, Zeabur will also start automatically.

## NPM Support

If your project root contains a `package.json`, Zeabur will automatically install Node.js and NPM for you; if your `package.json` contains a `build` script, Zeabur will automatically run `npm install && npm run build` to build the artifacts.

If you need to change the build commands (e.g., to run `npm run build:dist`), please refer to the section on Customizing Build and Start Commands.

## Customize Entrypoint

Zeabur will recognize `main.py`, `app.py`, `manage.py`, `server.py`, `app/__init__.py` as entry points by default. If your entry point is not listed above, you can set an environment variable

```env
ZBPACK_PYTHON_ENTRY=your-entrypoint.py
```

Or add the following setting to `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "python": {
        "entry": "your-entrypoint.py"
    }
}
```

This way, Zeabur will use `your-entrypoint.py` as the Python executable file.

If you want to deploy WSGI/ASGI applications (such as Django, Flask, FastAPI) and the entry point is in `__init__.py`, you need to provide the full path (including `__init__.py`):

```python
# server/__init__.py

app = Flask(__name__)
```

```env
ZBPACK_PYTHON_ENTRY=server/__init__.py
```

If your entry point is in `__main__.py`, you also need to provide the full path:

```python
# server/__main__.py

print("Hello!")
```

```env
ZBPACK_PYTHON_ENTRY=server/__main__.py
```

## Customizing Build and Start Commands

Zeabur allows you to customize Python build and start commands using environment variables or configuration files.

"Build commands" are suitable for scenarios where you need to download or compile custom artifacts (such as CSS, JavaScript, etc.) or write constant configurations. For example, if you want to write settings to the `/etc` folder, you can set an environment variable like this:

```env
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=echo 'your-configuration' > /etc/somewhere
```

Or add the following settings in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "build_command": "echo 'your-configuration' > /etc/somewhere"
}
```

You can also execute npm commands here. Note that Zeabur will only install Node.js and NPM if there is a `package.json` in the **project root directory**. If your project does not contain a `package.json`, `npm` commands will not be available:

```json
{
    "build_command": "npm install && npm run build:dist"
}
```

"Start commands" are suitable for scenarios when you need to run command before starting a Python application, such as adding `python3 migrate.py` to the original command to migrate database. For example, you can set an environment variable like this:

```env
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="python3 migrate.py && _startup"
```

Or add the following settings in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "start_command": "python3 migrate.py && _startup"
}
```

Here, `_startup` is Zeabur's original start command (which can be found in [the zbpack source code](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/tree/main/internal/python)). If you have a custom `start_command`, `_startup` must be included in your start command; otherwise, the Python application will not start.

Both `build_command` and `start_command` will be executed using a POSIX-compliant shell, so you can use `&&` to chain multiple commands, or use `;` to separate multiple commands.

## Web Scraping

### Playwright Support

If your dependency list (`requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) declares `playwright`, Zeabur will automatically prepare the necessary environment to run Playwright.

Note that Playwright [should be run in **Headless** mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-option-headless), which is usually the default.

### Selenium Support

If your dependency list (`requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) declares `seleniumbase` or `selenium`, Zeabur will automatically prepare the necessary environment to run Selenium.

Note that Selenium [should be run in **Headless** mode](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/headless-is-going-away/).

## Serverless

Zeabur supports deploying Python projects as serverless projects. However, this currently requires opt-in.
Please refer to the [Enable Serverless](/deploy/serverless) page to enable your serverless support.

## Setting the Python Version

Zeabur uses Python 3.10 as the default runtime environment. However, Zeabur will select the runtime environment based on the Python version set in your project. You can also customize the runtime environment as needed.

### Specifying the Python Version in Your Project

Specifying the Python version in your project is a more general approach that works in all environments.

For **Pipenv**, [specify the Python version in the `Pipfile`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/zh-cn/stable/basics.html#specifying-versions-of-python):

```toml
[requires]
python_version = "3.8"   # Specify the Python version here
```

For **Poetry**, [specify the Python version in the `pyproject.toml`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage#setting-a-python-version)：

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"  # Specify the Python version here
```

For **PDM**, [specify the `requires-python` in the `pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#python-requires):

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">= 3.8"  # Specify the Python version here
```

For **Rye**, [use the `rye pin` command to set the Python version](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/commands/pin/):

```bash
rye pin 3.8  # Specify the Python version here
```

### Specifying the Python Version in Zeabur

If you are using the traditional `requirements.txt` or need to override the Python version specified in your project for Zeabur, you can specify the Python version in `zbpack.json`.

```json
{
    "python": {
        "version": "3.8"
    }
}
```

Alternatively, use the `ZBPACK_PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable to specify the Python version:

```env
ZBPACK_PYTHON_VERSION=3.8
```

## Specifying the Streamlit Entry File

If you have declared the `streamlit` dependency in your project, and the filename is one of `app.py`, `main.py`, and `streamlit_app.py`, Zeabur will default to launching your application in Streamlit mode.

However, if your filename is not one of these three, you can specify the filename in the `zbpack.json`. For example, if your Streamlit application's filename is `myapp.py`:

```json
{
    "streamlit": {
        "entry": "myapp.py"
    }
}
```

This way, Zeabur will launch your `myapp.py` in Streamlit mode. You can also specify the filename using the environment variable `ZBPACK_STREAMLIT_ENTRY`:

```env
ZBPACK_STREAMLIT_ENTRY=myapp.py
```

## Specifying the Package Manager

Zeabur supports multiple Python package managers:

- Pip
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/)
- [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Zeabur determines the most suitable package manager based on the project structure. If you haven't committed your lockfile and the package manager used in the project is unclear, Zeabur will not install any packages. In this case, you can specify the package manager in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "python": {
        "package_manager": "pipenv"
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `ZBPACK_PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER` environment variable to specify the package manager:

```env
ZBPACK_PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pipenv
```

The value should be one of `pip`, `pipenv`, `poetry`, `pdm`, `rye`, or `uv`.
