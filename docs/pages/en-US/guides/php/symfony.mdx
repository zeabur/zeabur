# Symfony Deployment Guide

Zeabur uses NGINX + PHP-FPM as the default server to run your Symfony service.

## Automatic Optimization

By default, Zeabur runs the following optimization commands [^1] [^2]:

```bash
composer dump-env prod
composer run-script --no-dev post-install-cmd
php bin/console cache:clear
```

You can disable these automatic optimization commands by setting the `PHP_OPTIMIZE=false` variable. Then, use custom build commands to fine-tune your optimization process.

## Webpack Encore and AssetMapper Support

If Zeabur detects that your project is configured with AssetMapper or Webpack Encore, it will automatically run the following commands:

```bash
php bin/console asset-map:compile
```

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/encore production
```

Zeabur will first run `npm install`, `composer install`, and any custom build commands before building these assets.

You can disable automatic asset compilation by setting the `PHP_OPTIMIZE=false` variable. Then, use custom build commands to fine-tune your asset compilation process.
