# Bun

Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.

You can easily deploy your Bun app in Zeabur.

## Quick Start

### Create a Bun App

You can initialize a Bun app using the following command:

```bash
mkdir bun-app

cd bun-app

bun init
```

### Create a HTTP Server

Open `index.ts` and paste the following code snippet, which implements a simple HTTP server with `Bun.serve`.

Remember modify the port to `Bun.env.PORT` in your `serve` function to make sure the application can listen correctly on the environment variable `PORT` given by Zeabur.

```typescript filename="index.ts" {2}
const server = Bun.serve({
  port: Bun.env.PORT ?? 3000, // modify the port to Bun.env.PORT
  fetch() {
    return new Response("Bun on Zeabur!");
  },
});

console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port} ...`);
```

Additionally, make sure to specify an entry point in the `package.json` file.

<Callout type="info">
 Zeabur currently supports the following file extensions as entry point: `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.mts`, `.cjs`, or `.cts`.
 </Callout>

```json filename="package.json" {3}
{
  "name": "bun-app",
  "module": "index.ts", // let zeabur know where to start
  "type": "module",
  // ...
}
```

## Detection

Zeabur will automatically recognize your application as a Bun app. Ensure that you have a `bun.lockb` file in the root directory of your project.

```plainc {2}
root
├── bun.lockb
├── index.ts
└── package.json
```

You can install `bun-types` into your project if you prefer not to commit the `bun.lockb` file to your repository.

```json filename="package.json" {3}
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "bun-types": "latest"
  }
}
```

## Deploy

Click on **Git** button.

Search for your **Bun app** repository, click on import, your **Bun app** will start deploying.

## Ecosystem

Bun has a strong ecosystem, allowing you to build applications using various frameworks such as Astro, Nuxt, SvelteKit, ElysiaJS, and more.

You can deploy these applications and use Bun as your runtime or package manager.
