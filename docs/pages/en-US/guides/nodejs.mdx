# Deploying Node.js App

Zeabur supports various types of Node.js projects:

- Native projects (supporting NPM/Yarn/PNPM/Bun and other package managers)
- Projects bundled with [Vite](./nodejs/vite)
- [Qwik](./nodejs/qwik)
- [Next.js](./nodejs/nextjs)
- [Remix](./nodejs/remix)
- [Nuxt.js](./nodejs/nuxt)
- [Umi](./nodejs/umi)
- [Svelte (Kit)](./nodejs/svelte-kit)
- [Nest.js](./nodejs/nestjs)
- [Nue.js](./nodejs/nue)
- [Express](./nodejs/express)
- [Astro](./nodejs/astro)
- [Waku](./nodejs/waku)
- [Nue](./nodejs/nue)
- Create React App
- vue-cli
- Hexo
- Vitepress
- Astro (static, SSR)
- Slidev
- Docusaurus
- Solid Start (Node, static)

## Monorepo Support

Zeabur will automatically recognize [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), [Yarn Workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces), and most toolchains based on these two Monorepo approaches, such as Turborepo and Lerna.

Take the `basic` template of Turborepo as an example, its `pnpm-workspace.yaml` content is as follows:

```yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

Under `apps`, there are two directories, `docs` and `web`. By default, Zeabur will select the first Node.js application listed in the workspace package list to deploy. In this case, Zeabur will deploy the application under `apps/docs`. If you want to deploy `apps/web`, you can create a `zbpack.json` file in the root directory of the project and add the following content:

```json
{
    "app_dir": "apps/web"
}
```

Or use [environment variables](/deploy/variables) to set it:

```env
ZBPACK_APP_DIR=apps/web
```

This will deploy the `apps/web` application.

If your application is indeed in the root directory but leverage `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to place React components, design systems, etc, you can use the environment variable `ZBPACK_APP_DIR=/` or add the following to `zbpack.json`

```json
{
    "app_dir": "/"
}
```

to have Zeabur deploy your application placed in the root directory.

<Callout type="info">
    [Nx](https://nx.dev) and [Rush](https://rushjs.io), which are not based on the above two Monorepo approaches, are not yet supported for one-click deployment. You can refer to "Disable Cache Functionality" and "Modifying Build and Start Commands" to configure Monorepo.
</Callout>

## Disabling Cache Functionality

By default, Zeabur rearranges the installation process to speed up your CI/CD by recording the steps of dependency installation. This should not affect most Node.js projects, but if your project needs to use other files in the project during dependency installation which leads to a project compilation failure, you may need to disable the caching feature.

To disable this feature, create a `zbpack.json` file in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

```json
{
    "cache_dependencies": false
}
```

Or set [environment variables](/deploy/variables):

```env
ZBPACK_CACHE_DEPENDENCIES=false
```

## Modifying Build and Start Commands

If your project type is more specialized (such as using a custom Monorepo toolchain), you may need to specify the build and start commands for the service, for example, change the start command of the `frontend` service to `pnpm run start:frontend`; change the build command of the `api` service to `pnpm run start:api`.

Here are two ways to modify these commands.

### Modifying via Files

Add the following two settings to `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "build_command": "<custom build command>",
    "start_command": "<custom start command>"
}
```

The default settings in `zbpack.json` will be applied to all deployed services. If you want to specify different commands for different services (e.g., use a specific command for a service named `api` and another command for a service named `frontend`), you need to create a file named `zbpack.[service name].json`:

```json
// zbpack.api.json
{
    "build_command": "pnpm run build:api",
    "start_command": "pnpm run start:api"
}
```

```json
// zbpack.frontend.json
{
    "build_command": "pnpm run build:frontend",
    "start_command": "pnpm run start:frontend"
}
```

The priority of applying the settings is `zbpack.[service name].json` > `zbpack.json`.

### Modify Using Environment Variables

You can also use [environment variables](/deploy/variables) to set the build and start commands:

```env
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=pnpm run build:api
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND=pnpm run start:api
```

## Configure Node.js Version and Package Manager Version

### Node.js Version

By default, Zeabur uses the latest LTS version of Node.js to build your project.

If you want to use a different version, you can specify it in your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "engines": {
        "node": "18.1.0"
    }
}
```

### Package Manager Version

By default, Zeabur uses yarn to install dependencies for your project. If you want to use a different package manager, you can specify it in your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "packageManager": "pnpm@8.0.0"
}
```

## Static Website Deployment

If your project only needs to generate pure frontend web pages (without a backend server), it can be hosted directly using web servers like NGINX or Caddy. You can let Zeabur deploy it in a more lightweight way, thereby saving resource usage and costs.

1. First, confirm which folder your build command generates the final web files in (commonly `dist`, `build`, or `public` folders)
2. Then, add this environment variable to tell Zeabur where the web files are:

    ```env
    ZBPACK_OUTPUT_DIR=dist
    ```

    You can also write the configuration to `zbpack.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "output_dir": "dist"
    }
    ```

3. This way, after the next build completes, Zeabur will use the resource-efficient Caddy to host your website.

## Web Scraping

### Playwright Support

If your `package.json` declares `playwright-chromium`, Zeabur will automatically prepare the necessary environment to run Playwright.

Note that Playwright [should be run in **Headless** mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-option-headless), which is usually the default.

### Puppeteer Support

If your `package.json` declares `puppeteer`, Zeabur will automatically prepare the necessary environment to run Puppeteer.

Note that Puppeteer [should be run in **Headless** mode](https://pptr.dev/guides/headless-modes), which is usually the default.

## Additional Notes

1.  You should get the port to listen from `process.env.PORT`.

    For example:

    ```js
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
    // instead of const port = 3000
    ```

2.  Avoid using nodemon as runtime. Execute your command with general `node` command in production.

    For example, in `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node server.js"
            // instead of "start": "nodemon server.js"
        }
    }
    ```
