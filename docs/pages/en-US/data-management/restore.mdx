# Restore Backup

This section briefly describes various methods for restoring the backup of your service.

## Database

### PostgreSQL

Refer to the "Restore Backup" section on the [PostgreSQL Service Template Page](https://zeabur.com/templates/B20CX0).

### MySQL and MariaDB

Refer to the "Restore Backup" section on the [MySQL Service Template Page](https://zeabur.com/templates/DGLGRG) and the [MariaDB Service Template Page](https://zeabur.com/zh-TW/templates/46YKAR).

### Redis

You can use the [Redis `RESTORE` command](https://redis.io/commands/restore) to restore a backup.

Expand the Redis service's "Command to connect to your Redis" string, and you will see something like this:

```bash
redis-cli -h <host> -p <port> -a <password>
```

Insert the `<host>`, `<port>`, and `<password>` into the following command:

```bash
cat /path/to/backup.rdb | redis-cli -h <host> -p <port> -a <password> -x RESTORE <key> 0
```

### MongoDB

Expand the MongoDB service's "Command to connect to your MongoDB" string, and you will see something like this:

```bash
mongosh "<connection string>"
```

Copy the `<connection string>` into the terminal and execute the `mongorestore` command to restore the backup:

```bash
mongorestore "<connection string>" "<backup directory>"
```

## Volumes

If you want to restore data within [volumes](/data-management/volumes), you can refer to the [Upload Directory](/data-management/file-management) method to upload the backup files to the target directory and decompress them.
