# Volumes

On Zeabur, you can mount Volumes to persistently store your data within a service. Typically, services on Zeabur reset data to default values upon restarting (this is known as <abbr title="Stateless">stateless</abbr>), but if you need to persist data (making a service <abbr title="Stateful">stateful</abbr>), you can mount the directory that needs persistent storage onto Volumes. This way, even if the service restarts, the data will not be lost.

For pricing information on Volumes, please refer to [our pricing page](/billing/pricing).

<Callout type="info">
    If you only want to upload configuration files, using the [Config Editor](/data-management/config-edit) is more convenient and incurs no additional cost.
</Callout>

## Notice

- By default, Zeabur services support zero-downtime restarts, meaning that when you restart a service, traffic is seamlessly switched to the new instance and users will not experience any interruption.
- However, once Volumes are enabled, the service **cannot support zero-downtime restarts**. Each restart will first completely shut down the service before starting it again, resulting in a brief period of downtime.

## Mounting Volumes

Open the service page where you want to mount Volumes, click on the "Volumes" tab, and you will see a "Mount Volumes" button. After clicking it, you will see two fields:

![mount volumes](/data-management/volumes/mount-volumes.webp)

- **Volume ID** is a unique identifier for this Volume. You can use a simple name (such as `data`, `cache`, `photos`) to easily represent this Volume. This identifier is unrelated to the actual mounting result.
- **Mount Directory** is the directory where the Volume will be mounted, essentially the "folder that needs persistent storage." If you want to persistently store the `/data` directory in the service, enter `/data` here.

**Note that after mounting, the data in this directory will be completely cleared**. If you already have important data inside, please download it before mounting and restarting the service to avoid loss, and then re-import the data after mounting.

## Unmounting Volumes

If you want to stop billing for a particular Volume, click the "Delete" button next to the Volume. Deleting it will stop the billing for this space. Note that after deletion, the data in this directory will be **completely cleared** and **cannot be recovered**.

## Using Volumes in Template YAML

You can use `volumes` in the "Service Specification" to mount Volumes. For more information, please refer to the article, [Creating Templates from YAML](/template/template-in-code).
