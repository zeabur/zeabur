# File Management

<WorkingInProgress />

Zeabur offers users an intuitive file management interface that simplifies the management of all files within their services. Users can upload, download, edit files online, and create or delete files and folders through this interface.

<Callout type="warning">
  Some containers are too minimalistic and do not support components required for file management (such as cat), so this feature may not be available.
</Callout>

## Opening File Management

In the **Overview** tab of the service page, click **Files** to access the file management interface.

The file management interface consists of five main sections: (1) Create Folder, (2) Create File, (3) Refresh, (4) Directory List, and (5) File Content. The Refresh function reloads the file list after updates. The Directory List displays the complete directory structure, allowing users to expand or collapse subdirectories using the arrow beside folders. The File Content section enables file viewing and editing.

## Creating Files and Folders

To create a folder, click the "Create Folder" button, enter the full folder path, and press the confirm button to complete the process. To cancel, leave the path blank and click the back button.

Creating a file follows similar steps. Click the "Create File" button, enter the full file path, and press the confirm button. To cancel, leave the path blank and click the back button.

## File Editing

Select the file you want to edit from the directory list, and its content will appear in the file content section on the right.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently, only text file editing is supported. Please download binary files (images, audio, compressed files) instead. If you open a binary file, you will see a string of uneditable garbled text.
</Callout>

Users can edit directly in the file content section and click the **Save** button in the upper right corner to save changes. A confirmation message will appear in the lower right corner upon successful saving.

![edit file](/deploy/file-management/edit-file.png)

The edited file content will also be placed in the [Config Editor](/deploy/config-edit), ensuring that changes are retained after service restarts. To revert a file to its original state, remove the corresponding item in the Config Editor.

## Deleting Files and Folders

Hover over a file item and click the "Delete" button to delete the file. Note that File Management currently does not show a confirmation prompt before deletion, so proceed with caution.

![delete file](/deploy/file-management/delete-file.png)

Currently, File Management does not support deleting entire folders through the interface. You can run the `rm` command to delete entire folders using [Command Execution](/deploy/command-execution). Here is an example of using `rm -rf` to delete the entire `/tmp/testdir` folder:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/testdir
```

## Downloading Files

To download a file, hover over the file item and click the "Download" button. File Management will display the download progress in the lower right corner. After the download is complete, you can choose the save location.

## Uploading Files

To upload a file, simply drag it to the target directory. File Management will highlight the target upload location, and the upload will begin once you release the mouse. Currently, only single file uploads are supported.

### Uploading Directories

To upload an entire directory, first compress it into a `tar` file:

![compress directory as TAR file](/deploy/file-management/compress-as-tar.png)

Drag the compressed `tar` file to the `/tmp` directory in the Zeabur file management interface:

![upload TAR file to temporary path](/deploy/file-management/upload-tar-file.png)

Then run the following command with [Command Execution](/deploy/command-execution) to display the file hierarchy of the `tar` file:

```bash
tar tvf <your uploaded tar file>
```

After confirming the hierarchy is correct, use the following command to extract:

```bash
tar xvf <your uploaded tar file> -C <your desired extraction directory>
```

For example:

```bash
tar xvf /tmp/myfolder.tar -C /usr/share
```

The extracted folder structure is as follows:

![extracted folder structure](/deploy/file-management/extracted-folder-structure.png)

After completion, you can delete the `tar` file in the `/tmp` directory to save space.
