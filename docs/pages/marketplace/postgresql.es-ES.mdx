# PostgreSQL Service

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

Zeabur provides a one-click deployment feature for PostgreSQL service, allowing you to deploy a PostgreSQL database on Zeabur in seconds.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  At present, Zeabur's PostgreSQL service supports the latest version. More
  versions of the PostgreSQL service will be supported in the future, so stay
  tuned.
</Callout>

## Deploy PostgreSQL Service

In your project page, click on **Add service** button and select **Marketplace** and then find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, Zeabur will automatically start deploying your PostgreSQL service.

## Environment Variables

After you deploy the PostgreSQL service, Zeabur will automatically inject the relevant environment variables into other services.

- `POSTGRES_HOST`
- `POSTGRES_PORT`
- `POSTGRES_USERNAME`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

Sometimes, we can use the self-added `DATABASE_URL` to replace the above environment variables, for example:

```bash copy
postgres://<POSTGRES_USERNAME>:<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@<POSTGRES_HOST>:<POSTGRES_PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

Here, `<DATABASE_NAME>` is the name of the database that you added yourself.

## Adding a Database

By default, the username and database name in Zeabur's PostgreSQL are both `root`.

Sometimes you may need to add a `databse` to the PostgreSQL service, you can use the following methods to add a database.

- [PgAdmin](#pgadmin)
- [PSQL (sql shell)](#psql-sql-shell)

### PgAdmin

[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is the most popular and feature-rich open-source management and development platform for PostgreSQL. You can use [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to connect to the PostgreSQL database deployed on Zeabur.

#### Install PgAdmin

You need to install the pgAdmin client first. Go to pgAdmin's [official website](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to download and follow the instructions to install.

#### Add a Database

First, you need to click **Add New Server** and enter the relevant information:

Then, you can add a database in the **Databases** section.

### PSQL (sql shell)

[psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) is a terminal-based PostgreSQL tool. It allows you to enter queries interactively, send them to PostgreSQL, and view the query results. In addition, [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) provides many shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating various tasks.

#### Install PSQL

To use PSQL, you need to install the PostgreSQL client first. Go to PostgreSQL's [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to download and follow the instructions to install.

After the installation, you may need to restart your computer. You can check if the installation is successful by entering the following command:

```bash copy
psql --version
```

#### Add a Database

You can use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) to connect to the PostgreSQL database deployed on Zeabur by simply entering the following command:

```bash copy
psql -h <POSTGRES_HOST> -p <POSTGRES_PORT> -U <POSTGRES_USERNAME> -W
```

```sql copy
CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME>;
```

Make sure to enter this command in the `postgres=#` state to execute it correctly.
