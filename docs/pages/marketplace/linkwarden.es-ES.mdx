## Method 2: Deploy from marketplace

### Step 1: Create a project

First, we need to create a project. Go to the [Projects page](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects), and you will see a list of your projects. Click the "New Project" button to create a new project.

### Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL service

Linkwarden requires a PostgreSQL database to store data. Click the "Create Service" button and select "Prebuilt", you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, your PostgreSQL service will be deployed automatically.

### Step 3: Deploy Linkwarden service

Click the "Create Service" button again, and select "Prebuilt", you will find Linkwarden in the list.

After deploying Linkwarden, you need to fill in the environment variables for Linkwarden service.

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=${PASSWORD}
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
NEXTAUTH_URL=${ZEABUR_WEB_URL}
```

### Step 4: Bind domain

While you are waiting for this service to start running, you can bind a domain to it.

Open the "Domain" tab in the service page and click on "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).
