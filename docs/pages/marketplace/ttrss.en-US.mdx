# Deploy Tiny Tiny RSS Service

[Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) is a free and open source web-based news feed (RSS/Atom) reader and aggregator

This article will teach you how to deploy your own Tiny Tiny RSS service on Zeabur through the Marketplace and bind your own domain name.

## Step 1: Create a project

## Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

Although Tiny Tiny RSS is compatible with MySQL, it is highly recommended to use PostgreSQL as the database.

You can deploy PostgreSQL in marketplace with one click.

Click on the "Add Service" button or press "cmd + k" in project page, and select "Marketplace".

Find Tiny Tiny RSS in the list and click on it to start deploying.

## Step 3: Bind a domain

In the "Domain" block of the Tiny Tiny RSS service in the Zeabur dashboard, you can bind a domain to it.

This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step 4: Deploy Mercury Parser API Service(Optional)

If you want to use the Mercury plugin, you need to additionally deploy a Mercury Parser API service.

First fork a [Mercury Parser API](https://github.com/HenryQW/mercury-parser-api) repository from GitHub

Then create a new service and choose to build from Git

In the "Domain Name" block of the Mercury Parser API service in the Zeabur console, you need to bind a domain name to obtain a certificate to generate a free domain name provided by Zeabur.

Finally enable the Mercury plugin in Tiny Tiny RSS and enter your domain

## Step 5: Enjoy it

After the deployment is complete, you can access your Tiny Tiny RSS service through the domain name you bound.
