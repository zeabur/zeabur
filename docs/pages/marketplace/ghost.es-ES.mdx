# Deploy Ghost Service

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a powerful application for new media creators to publish, share, and develop their content business.

This article will teach you how to deploy your own Ghost service on Zeabur through the service market, and bind your own domain name.

## Step 1: Create a project

First, we need to create a project. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, and you will see a list of your projects. Click the "Create Project" button at the end of the list.

## Step 2: Deploy MySQL Service

Ghost service currently only supports MySQL databases in Zeabur. Before creating a Ghost service, you need to deploy a MySQL service (the database will be automatically created by the Ghost service).

Click the "Create Service" button and select "Marketplace". You will find MySQL in the list.

Select it to deploy the MySQL service.

## Step 3: Deploy Ghost Service

In the Zeabur console, click the "Create Service" button and select "Marketplace". You will find Ghost in the list.

Select it to deploy the Ghost service.

It should be noted that because we have deployed the MySQL service before deploying Ghost, Zeabur will automatically help you inject MySQL-related environment variables into Ghost's service, so there is no need to manually configure database information.

If you deploy Ghost before deploying MySQL, you need to restart Ghost after deploying MySQL to make Ghost use the correct database connection information.

After deployment, click the "Suspend" button to pause the Ghost service, so we can start preparing the domain.

## Step 4: Bind a domain

In the "Domain" block of the Ghost service in the Zeabur console, you can bind a domain to it. This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

After adding the domain, open the "Environment Variables" section and modify the `url` to the domain you just bound. Ghost will automatically restart after the modification.

## Step 5: Log in and configure Ghost

After binding the domain, you can add `/ghost` to the end of the domain to start initiating your Ghost service.
