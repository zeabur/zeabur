# Deploy MySQL

Zeabur provides a one-click deployment feature for MySQL service, allowing you to quickly deploy a MySQL database on Zeabur.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  At present, Zeabur's MySQL service supports the `8.0` version. More versions
  of the MySQL service will be supported in the future.
</Callout>

## Deploying a MySQL service

In your project, click **Deploy New Service** and select **Deploy MySQL Service** from **Deploy Other Services**.

After clicking **Deploy**, Zeabur will automatically deploy the MySQL service for you.

## Environment Variables

After deploying the MySQL service, Zeabur will automatically inject relevant environment variables into other services.

- `MYSQL_HOST`
- `MYSQL_PORT`
- `MYSQL_USERNAME`
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

Sometimes, we can create a `DATABASE_URL` to replace the above environment variables, for example:

```bash copy
mysql://<MYSQL_USERNAME>:<MYSQL_PASSWORD>@<MYSQL_HOST>:<MYSQL_PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

Here, `<DATABASE_NAME>` is the name of the database that you added yourself.

## Adding a Database

By default, the username and database name in Zeabur's MySQL are both `root`. Here, we need to add the first database ourselves, which can be done in the following ways.

- [MySQL Workbench](#mysql-workbench)
- [mysqlsh](#mysqlsh)

### MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a database visualization tool that can be used to design, maintain, and manage MySQL databases. It has an easy-to-use interface and can be used to query, back up and restore databases, as well as diagnose and optimize database performance.

You can use [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to connect to the MySQL database deployed on Zeabur.

First, you need to click the button next to **MySQL connections** to add a connection.

Then, click **Store in Keychain** to save the password.

Next, you can execute SQL syntax in the Query Editor to add a database. Enter:

```sql copy
CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME>
```

### mysqlsh

[mysqlsh](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/) is an advanced command-line tool for managing and operating MySQL databases. It supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and SQL, allowing users to write scripts in their preferred languages.

First, you can connect to the MySQL database deployed on Zeabur using the following command:

```bash copy
mysqlsh --uri mysql://root:<MYSQL_PASSWORD>@<MYSQL_HOST>:<MYSQL_PORT>
```

![mysqlsh-connect](/databases/mysql/mysqlsh-connect.png)

Then, switch to SQL mode:

```bash copy
\sql
```

![mysqlsh-sql](/databases/mysql/mysqlsh-sql.png)

Finally, you can execute SQL syntax to add a database. Enter:

```sql copy
create database <DATABASE_NAME>;
```
