After selecting「Botway CE」, Zeabur will automatically deploy the Botway CE service for you.

## Environment Variables

After the Botway CE service is successfully deployed, Zeabur will automatically inject environment variables into the service. Currently, the following variables are available:

- `GIT_REPO`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `PASSWORD`
- `PKGS`

## Connecting to Botway CE

Here I use Zeabur's built-in Generate Domain feature to create a Domain, click Generate Domain in the **Networking** section.
