## Method 2: Deploy from Prebuilt Marketplace

### Step 1: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, you will see all your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

### Step 2: Deploy Flowise

In the Zeabur dashboard, click "Create Service" and select "Prebuilt", you will find Flowise in the list.

After selecting Flowise, your Flowise service will be deployed automatically.

### Step 3: Bind Domain Name

While you are waiting for your Flowise to start running, you can bind a domain to it.

Open the "Networking" tab in the service page and click on "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).
