# Deploy Redis Service

Zeabur provides a one-click deployment feature of Redis service, allowing you to quickly deploy a Redis database on Zeabur.

## Deploying Redis Services

In your project, click **Add Service** and select **Marketplace** and then search for `Redis`:

![Deploy "Redis"](/databases/redis/deploy-redis.gif)

Once you click "Redis", Zeabur will automatically deploy the Redis service for you.

## Environment Variables

After the Redis service is successfully deployed, Zeabur will automatically inject environment variables into the service. Currently, the following variables are available:

- `REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING`
- `REDIS_HOST`
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- `REDIS_PORT`
- `REDIS_URI`

## Connecting to the Database

- [Redis cli](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/references/cli-utilities/redis-cli/)

### redis-cli

[redis-cli](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/) is a command-line tool that allows interaction with the Redis database. Using redis-cli, you can execute Redis commands in a command line terminal or interactive mode.

After downloading and installing as per the documentation, return to Zeabur. In the Redis service, click on the Instructions tab, and then click the copy button for `Command to connect to your Redis` to copy the connection address.

Paste the copied command into the terminal and enter `PING` to test if the connection is successful:

![test-connection](/databases/redis/redis-test-connection.png)

Now, you can start operating Redis.
