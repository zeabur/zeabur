# Deploy Ghost 

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a powerful application for new media creators to publish, share, and develop their content business.

This article will teach you how to deploy your own Ghost service on Zeabur within a few minutes.

## Deploy Ghost from Template

Ghost requires MySQL as a database, so you can not deploy Ghost service directly from the image. It won't work until you have a MySQL service running in the same project.

We have made a Ghost template with MySQL service, so you can deploy both services at once with a single click.

### Step 1: Open Ghost template page

First of all, visit [the template page for Ghost](https://https://zeabur.com/templates/SHEU50).

You will see that template is already configured with MySQL service, so you don't need to do anything.

### Step 2: Deploy template

Click on the **Deploy** button, and then select a region to deploy your services.

After the selection, you will be automatically redirected to the project page where you can see the deployment progress.

Wait a few more seconds, and your Ghost service will be deployed successfully and start running.

### Step 3: Access Ghost

You need to bind a domain to access your Ghost service after the deployment.

You can follow the [guide to bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding) for more details.

### Step 4: Setup Ghost

After the domain is bound, you can click on the domain to access the Ghost homepage. Add `/ghost` after the domain to access the Ghost admin settings page.
