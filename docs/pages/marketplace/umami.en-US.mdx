# Deploy Umami

[Umami](https://umami.is/) is a simple, fast, website analytics tool for those who care about privacy. It's the open-source alternative to Google Analytics.

This article will show you how to deploy Umami on Zeabur with a custom domain.

## Deploy Umami from template

Since Umami requires PostgreSQL as a database, you can not deploy it directly from the image.

We have made a template for you to deploy Umami with PostgreSQL in one click.

### Step 1: Open Umami template page

First of all, visit [the template page](https://zeabur.com/templates/01NQCC) for Umami.

You can see that the template is already configured with PostgreSQL service, so you don't need to do anything.

Click on the Deploy button, and then select a region to deploy your services.

After the selection, you will be automatically redirected to the project page where you can see the deployment progress.

Wait a few more seconds, and your Umami service will be deployed successfully and start running.

### Step 3: Bind domain

You need to bind a domain to access your Linkwarden service after the deployment.

You can follow [the guide to bind a domain](/deploy/domain-binding) for more details.

### Step 4: Log in and configure Umami

After binding the domain, you can click the domain to enter the Umami login page, and use the default account `admin` and password `umami` to log in.
