# Deploy Umami

[Umami](https://umami.is/) is a simple, fast, website analytics tool for those who care about privacy. It's the open-source alternative to Google Analytics.

This article will show you how to deploy Umami on Zeabur with a custom domain.

## Step 1: Create a project

First, we need to create a project. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, and you will see a list of your projects. Click the "Create Project" button at the end of the list.

## Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL

Umami supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL. You can choose either one to store your data.

In this article, we will use PostgreSQL as an example. Click the "Create Service" button and select "Marketplace". You will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, you can give the service a custom name and click "Deploy".

## Step 3: Create a database

To run Umami, we need to create a database named `umami` in PostgreSQL.

Please connect to your PostgreSQL service with any PostgreSQL client. In this article, we will use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-psql.html) to connect.

You can find the psql connection command or other connection information in the "Connection" block of the PostgreSQL service in the Zeabur console.

```bash
psql postgresql://root:password@infra.zeabur.com:12345
```

Then, please enter the following command in psql to create the `umami` database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE umami;
```

## Step 4: Deploy Umami

In the Zeabur console, click the "Create Service" button and select "Marketplace". You will find Umami in the list.

After selecting Umami, you can give the service a custom name and click "Deploy".

  If you deploy Umami before deploying PostgreSQL, you need to restart Umami after deploying PostgreSQL to make Umami use the correct database connection information.

## Step 5: Bind a domain

In the "Domain" block of the Umami service in the Zeabur console, you can bind a domain to it. This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step 6: Log in and configure Umami

After binding the domain, you can click the domain to enter the Umami login page, and use the default account `admin` and password `umami` to log in.
