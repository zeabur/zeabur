## Deploy Linkwarden from template

Since Linkwarden requires PostgreSQL as a database, you can not deploy it directly from the image.

We have made a template for you to deploy Linkwarden with PostgreSQL in one click.

### Step 1: Open Linkwarden template page

First of all, visit [the template page](https://zeabur.com/templates/1E5ABT) for Linkwarden.

You will see that template is already configured with PostgreSQL service, so you don't need to do anything.

Wait a few more seconds, and your Linkwarden service will be deployed successfully and start running.

### Step 3: Bind domain

You need to bind a domain to access your Linkwarden service after the deployment.

You can follow [the guide to bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding) for more details.
