# Deploy WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is an open-source software that allows anyone to easily build beautiful websites, blogs, or apps.

This article will show you how to deploy your own WordPress service on Zeabur with your desired domain through Marketplace.

## Deploy WordPress from template

### Step 1: Open WordPress template page

Since WordPress requires a MySQL database, you can not deploy it directly from the image.

We have made a template for you to deploy WordPress with MySQL in one click.

After the selection, you will be automatically redirected to the project page where you can see the deployment progress.

Wait a few more seconds, and your WordPress service will be deployed successfully and start running.

### Step 3: Bind domain

You need to bind a domain to access your WordPress service after the deployment.

You can follow [the guide to bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding) for more details.

### Step 4: Log in and Set Up WordPress

After completing the domain binding, you can click on the domain name to enter the WordPress installation interface. First, select the language you want and click "Continue" (or something like this in your language):
