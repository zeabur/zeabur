# Deploy n8n

[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

This article will show you how to deploy n8n with PostgreSQL on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, you will see all your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

## Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

n8n will store user identity data in a PostgreSQL database. Click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, Zeabur will automatically start deploying your PostgreSQL service.

## Step 3: Create a Database

In order for the n8n service to run properly, we need to create a database named `n8n` in the PostgreSQL database first.

Usaully, you need a PostgreSQL client to connect to the PostgreSQL service and create a database. But Zeabur provides a convenient way to create a database.

In your PostgreSQL service, you can find a tab named **Database**, where you can manage your databases with one click.

**n8n** requires a database named `n8n`, so we need to create a database named `n8n`.
Type `n8n` in the input box and click the **Create** button, then Zeabur will create a database named `n8n` for you.

## Step 4: Deploy n8n Service

Once you have successfully create a PostgreSQL service and setup the database, you can start deploying n8n now.
In the Zeabur console, click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", you will find n8n in the list.

  If you deploy n8n first without deploying PostgreSQL, then you need to restart
  the n8n service after deploying the PostgreSQL service to let n8n get the
  correct database connection information.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Bind a domain

In the "Domain" block of the n8n service in the Zeabur dashboard, you can bind a domain to it.

This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step 6: Setup Account

After the deployment is complete, you can access your n8n service through the domain name you bound.

You will see a page like this:

Follow the instructions on the page to set up your n8n account. After the setup is complete, you can use n8n normally.
