# Deploy Halo Service

[Halo](https://halo.run/) is a powerful and easy-to-use open source website building tool, with rich themes and plugins to help you build the ideal site in your mind.

This article will teach you how to deploy your own Halo service on Zeabur through the service market, and bind your own domain name.

## Step 1: Create a project

<CreateProject />

## Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

Halo service currently only supports PostgreSQL databases in Zeabur. Before creating a Halo service, you need to deploy a PostgreSQL service and create a database.

Click the "Create Service" button and select "Marketplace". You will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, you can give the service a custom name and click "Deploy".

## Step 3: Create a database

To run Halo, we need to create a database named `halo` in PostgreSQL.

Please connect to your PostgreSQL service with any PostgreSQL client. In this article, we will use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-psql.html) to connect.

You can find the psql connection command or other connection information in the "Connection" block of the PostgreSQL service in the Zeabur console.

For exampleï¼š

```bash
psql postgresql://root:password@infra.zeabur.com:12345
```

Then, please enter the following command in psql to create the `halo` database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE halo;
```

## Step 4: Deploy Halo Service

In the Zeabur console, click the "Create Service" button and select "Marketplace". You will find Halo in the list.

After selecting Halo, you can give the service a custom name and click "Deploy".

<Callout>
It should be noted that because we have deployed the PostgreSQL service before deploying Halo, Zeabur will automatically help you inject PostgreSQL-related environment variables into Halo's service, so there is no need to manually configure database information.

If you deploy Halo before deploying PostgreSQL, you need to restart Halo after deploying PostgreSQL to make Halo use the correct database connection information.

## Step 5: Bind a domain

In the "Domain" block of the Halo service in the Zeabur console, you can bind a domain to it. This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step 6: Log in and configure Halo

After binding the domain, you can click the domain name to enter the setup page of Halo, and follow the prompts to complete the setup and use the Halo service.
