### Step 3: Bind a domain

While you are waiting for this service to be started and get running, you can bind a domain to it. 
This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

Open the "Domain" tab in the service page and click on "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding.en-US.mdx).
