# Serverless Output Format

Zeabur supports both containerized and serverless deployment. When you deploy your project to Zeabur, Zeabur will use [zbpack](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack) to analyze and build your project automatically. You can find more information about the build process in [Builds](./builds).

Containerized deployment requires more computing resources, because even if the service is not in use, it needs to be kept open to maintain various internal states of the service. The serverless deployment method decomposes the service into multiple serverless functions that can be used immediately. When the service receives an external request, it executes the function to calculate and return the result, thereby providing higher scalability and saving unnecessary costs.

## Build Output Format

Without any additional configuration, zbpack will choose whether to use the serverless method based on the development framework used by the project. If zbpack decides to use the serverless method for building, you can find the `.zeabur/output` directory in the project directory after the build is completed. The structure under the directory is as follows:

```
.zeabur/output
├── static
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── functions
│   ├── index.func
│   └── ...
```

The `static` directory stores static resources such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., and the `functions` directory stores serverless functions. Each directory ending with `.func` is a function entry, and they correspond to a path after the service is deployed online, for example:

- `functions/index.func` corresponds to the path `/`
- `functions/users/get.func` corresponds to the path `/users/get`
- `functions/api/orders.func` corresponds to the path `/api/orders`
- `functions/api/orders/[id].func` corresponds to the path `/api/orders/[id]`, where `[id]` is a dynamic path that can match any path.

To maximize the compatibility of the build output, zbpack's serverless build output format is as consistent as possible with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)'s [Build Output API (v3)](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3). In this way, the authors and teams of existing frameworks or new frameworks in the future do not need to re-develop adapters for different platforms.

## Pure Static Output

For purely static website frameworks, such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), etc., there will only be a `static` directory in the `.zeabur/output` directory after zbpack is built, and there is no `functions` directory. This is because purely static website frameworks do not need to use the serverless method for deployment, so zbpack will directly package all static resources into the `static` directory, and directly deploy the resources in the `static` directory to the CDN during deployment.

## Serverless Functions

For frameworks that need to use Serverless, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), etc., there will be two directories, `static` and `functions`, in the `.zeabur/output` directory after zbpack is built. The `static` directory stores static resources, and the `functions` directory stores serverless functions.

For services deployed on Zeabur, you can see whether they are currently deployed using the serverless method or the containerized method in the upper right corner of the service details page:
