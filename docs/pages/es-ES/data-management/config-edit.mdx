# Editing Configuration Files

When running a service, you can customize it by using a configuration file. Zeabur provides a configuration file editor that allows you to specify the path and content of your configuration. The configuration file is automatically mounted upon service startup.

We use [NGINX](https://nginx.com/) as a front proxy for [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) to show how to edit NGINX custom configuration files using the configuration file editor.

## Step One: Create a Project

Create a Project in [Zeabur Dash](https://dash.zeabur.com/).

## Step Two: Create Services

Create your NGINX and Vaultwarden prebuilt services in the project you created in Step One.

![Create Vaultwarden Service](/data-management/config-edit/create-vultwarden-service.en-US.png)

## Step Three: Edit Nginx Service Configuration File

1. Click on the `Settings` tab in the Services section for your NGINX service. Then, locate the `Configs` section in the expanded tab. Next, click the `Open Config Editor` button to access the configuration file editor.

2. In the editor, we click on the `Add Config file` button to add a configuration file. In the sheet that appears, enter the filename and path for your configuration in the `Config Path` text box. In this example, we will use `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Finally, click the `Save Config` button.

    The `Config Path` above must be an absolute path. Customize it according to your requirements.
</Callout>

3. Edit the configuration file according to your requirements. In this case, we will add a `server` configuration to enable reverse-proxying for our vaultwarden service.

```nginx
worker_processes  4;
error_log  stderr;
worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;

events {}

http {
  default_type application/octet-stream;
  log_format   main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
    '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
  access_log   /dev/stdout  main;
  sendfile     on;
  tcp_nopush   on;
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 128; # this seems to be required for some vhosts

  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      "";
  }

  server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    server_name _;

    location / {
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;

      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      proxy_pass http://vaultwarden.zeabur.internal:80;
    }
  }
}
```
To allow others to access our internal Vaultwarden through our NGINX service, we use the `proxy_pass vaultwarden.zeabur.internal` directive in NGINX. This instructs NGINX to proxy all requests from this location to Vaultwarden. We make use of the [Private Network](/deploy/private-networking) feature to access Vaultwarden with a fixed hostname within our private network.

4. Click the `Save` button to save your configuration file.

## Step Four: Restart the Service

We have completed the configuration of NGINX in the previous steps. Now, we need to restart the service. Go to the `Instructions` section and click the `Restart` button to apply your configuration changes.

![Restart Service](/data-management/config-edit/restart-service.en-US.png)

Once you have [bound a domain name](/deploy/domain-binding) to your NGINX service, you can access the vaultwarden service using your domain name.
