# Pricing

Zeabur offers a consumption-based pricing model for your projects. You won't get any bills for resources you don't use.

Instead, Zeabur charges by the minute for each vCPU and memory resource that your services actually use.

## Pricing Rates

Zeabur computes the usage cost with the following formula:

`Total Service Time` (in minutes) x (`Memory usage` (in GB) + `vCPU usage` (in cores))

And the rates for usage are as the following:

- Memory - **US$0.0001** / GB-minute (About US$4 / GB-month)

- vCPU - **US$0.0003** / vCPU-minute (About US$12 / vCPU-month)

- Network Egress - First 10GB is free for Serverless Plan, 100GB for Developer Plan and Team Plan. Then **US$10** / 100GB.

- Persistent Volume - **US$0.2** / GB-month

There is no minimum service cost and you won't get charged if your services use no resources or crashed.
