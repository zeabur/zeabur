# Creating Templates from YAML

<WorkingInProgress />

You can use the `zeabur` CLI to deploy, create, and manage templates in a format similar to [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or [Kubernetes Object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/) from YAML.

## YAML (Resource) Format

Zeabur uses a single YAML file to describe the template resources referred to as **Template Resource**.

```yaml
apiVersion: zeabur.com/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
    name: RSSHub
spec:
    description: Everything is RSSible
    icon: https://docs.rsshub.app/logo.png

    variables:
        - key: PUBLIC_DOMAIN
          type: DOMAIN
          name: Domain

A **Template** can be divided into three main sections: "Template Information", "Service Specifications", and "Localization". The complete format can be viewed in the [Zeabur Schema Repository](https://json-schema.app/view/%23?url=https%3A%2F%2Fschema.zeabur.app%2Ftemplate.json). Below, each field's purpose and how it is presented on the Zeabur template page will be briefly described.

### Template Definition

![Appearance of each field in the template definition on the Zeabur template page](/template/template-in-code/field-in-template-page.webp)

`apiVersion` and `kind` are always `zeabur.com/v1` and `Template`.

In `metadata`, `name` is the arbitrary template name, such as `RSSHub`, `Lobe-Chat`, and `ChatGPT API`. This will appear in the `WeWe RSS` block in the image above.

In `spec`, `description` is a brief summary of the template, displayed under the template title. `icon` is the template's icon, a URL pointing to an image, shown next to the template title. `tags` are the template's labels, with reference categories available on the [template browsing page's left `Tags` section](https://zeabur.com/templates). Correct tags not only help users find templates easily but also optimize SEO.

`readme` is the template's documentation, written in Markdown format, displayed at the bottom of the template page. `coverImage` is shown above the documentation and is also a URL pointing to an image; it can be left blank.

`variables` are the variables users can set during deployment. The `type` can be `STRING` (a normal variable string) or `DOMAIN` (Zeabur guides domain setup); `key` corresponds to the service's environment variables, with Zeabur automatically creating an environment variable in all services as specified. `name` and `description` correspond to the variable name and description during template deployment, as shown below.

![Variable presentation in Template deployment popup](/template/template-in-code/variable-example.webp)

### Service Specifications

![Appearance of each field in the service specifications on the Zeabur Dashboard project page](/template/template-in-code/service-details.webp)

`services` are the template's service specifications. Zeabur will deploy the specified services into the project during deployment. The service's `name` is its name, and `icon` is its icon. `template` declares whether the service is a Docker image (`PREBUILT`) or a service deployed from Git (`GIT`).

`dependencies` declare the services this service depends on. Zeabur can wait for the specified services to start before starting your service, avoiding the trouble of repeatedly restarting services. For example, if your service `blog` depends on `redis` and `postgresql`, you can specify as below. Note that `redis` and `postgresql` must also be services defined in the template.

```yaml
dependencies:
    - redis
    - postgresql
```

The startup relationship is as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Dependencies
    direction LR

    redis
    postgresql

    redis -- Wait 2 seconds to start --> postgresql
  end

  Dependencies -- Wait for both to start --> blog
```

The `domainKey` indicates which service the domain (type `DOMAIN`) variable in the template definition should be bound to. In the example above, `spec.variables` has a variable `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` of type `DOMAIN`, and the RSSHub service specification has a `domainKey` pointing to `PUBLIC_DOMAIN`. When deploying, the domain set in `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` will be bound to the RSSHub service.

`spec` is the Service Specification. Detailed information on each field can be found in the [Template Service Specifications documentation](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fproperties%2Fspec/%23%2Fproperties%2Fspec%2Fproperties%2Fservices%2Fitems/%23%2Fproperties%2Fspec%2Fproperties%2Fservices%2Fitems%2Fproperties%2Fspec?url=https%3A%2F%2Fschema.zeabur.app%2Ftemplate.json). Below is a brief description of key points in the service specifications:

For `PREBUILT` services, you need to specify the Docker image (`image`), and optionally the execution command and parameters (`command` and `args`). If your image is stored in a private registry, you may want to specify the `username` and `password` to pull. Additionally, you can specify the user ID (`runAsUserID`) to run your container in the non-root mode. For `GIT` services, you need to specify the Git repository type (currently only `GITHUB`), repository ID (currently only GitHub's [`repoID`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47223479)), and optionally the branch (`branch`).

`ports` specifies the service Ports to be exposed to the project or even externally. HTTP services can be connected using a domain name (e.g., `https://my-service.zeabur.app`), while TCP and UDP services can use Zeabur's forwarding link `xxx.clusters.zeabur.com:12345`. For example, if `type` is `HTTP` and `port` is `12345`, others can connect to your service listening on `12345` port via `https://my-service.zeabur.app`.

`volumes` specifies the persistent storage paths for the service. In principle, Zeabur restores the service's state to the initial state (Stateless) after each Redeploy or Restart, but if you need to persist some data, you can use `volumes` to specify the persistent storage path. For example, if `dir` is `/data`, it means your service can persist data under the `/data` path until the service is deleted.

`instructions` tell other users how to use your service, such as the example `Redis Connection String`, which provides how others can connect to Redis using a Client. `type` can be `DOMAIN` (a button that directs to the specified URL when clicked), `TEXT` (text), `PASSWORD` (password, hidden by default), and `category` is a customizable classification, not currently displayed on the frontend.

`env` is the service's environment variables. `default` is the default value of the environment variable, `expose` indicates whether other projects can directly use this variable or use the `${VARIABLE}` syntax to reference this variable, and `readonly` indicates whether it is read-only (cannot be modified after the service is created). For example, if `REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING`'s `expose` is `true`, other services can connect to Redis through the `REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable, and can also reference this connection string in other environment variables using `${REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING}`.

`configs` are the file-based settings for the service. You can use `path` and `template` to specify the default configuration file, making it easier for users to modify it. Use `envsubst` to replace variable references in the template with their corresponding values. For example, when `envsubst` is enabled and the variable `MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo.zeabur.internal:27017` is set:

```yaml {6}
configs:
    - path: /config.yaml
      template: |
        mongo:
            uri: ${MONGO_URI}
      envsubst: true
```

The `/config.yml` file will be populated with the following content in the service instance:

```yaml filename="/config.yaml"
mongo:
    uri: mongodb://mongo.zeabur.internal:27017
```

You can also specify the `permission` of your configuration file. Note that `permission` must be a decimal number, converted from the octal [UNIX file permissions](https://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/UNIXpermiss.htm). Here are some common permission mappings:

| `permission` value | Raw octal value | Read | Write | Execute | Suitable for |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---- | ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| 256                | 0400            | O    | X     | X       | Confidential files (e.g., passwords) |
| 420                | 0644            | O    | O     | X       | Normal readable and writable files. Default permission |
| 493                | 0755            | O    | O     | O       | Executable files (e.g., bash scripts) |

"Read", "Write", and "Execute" here refer to the permissions of the container user. For details (groups, everyone, etc.), please refer to the above URL.

`gpu` specifies the GPU resources required by the service. Currently, you can only enable or disable these resources. To use GPU resources, set `gpu.enabled` to `true`:

```yaml
gpu:
    enabled: true
```

### Localization

You can localize the `description`, `coverImage`, `variables` titles and descriptions, and `readme` in the template definition. Zeabur will display the corresponding localized content based on the visitor's language.

![Presentation of various fields localized on the Zeabur template page](/template/template-in-code/localization.webp)

You can localize your contents to `zh-TW`, `zh-CN`, `ja-JP`, and `es-ES`. Note that `en-US` is the default language of the template, and you should write directly in the template definition. The format of `description`, `readme`, and `coverImage` is the same as in the template definition. You can translate the field `name` and `description` in `variables`; however, other parts (`type` and `key`) must remain the same as in the template definition fields.

Leaving fields blank (or omitting them) will automatically use the default content from the template definition. In the above example, the `coverImage` is omitted, so Zeabur picks the `coverImage` from the template definition.

## Deploying Templates with the `zeabur` CLI

If you have finished writing the Template Resource YAML and want to test the deployment, you can use the `zeabur` CLI to deploy the template.

```
$ cat wp.yaml | head -n 10
apiVersion: zeabur.com/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
    name: WordPress
spec:
    description: A content management system (CMS) that allows you to host and build websites.
    coverImage: https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/what-is-wordpress.png
    icon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeabur/service-icons/main/marketplace/wordpress.png
    variables:
        - key: WORDPRESS_DOMAIN

$ npx zeabur@latest template deploy -f wp.yaml
```

First, the `zeabur` CLI will ask you which project you want to deploy to, then it will ask you to fill in the variables specified in the services' `variables`, and finally, it will deploy the template to the project you specified.

```
$ npx zeabur@latest template deploy -f wp.yaml
? Select project  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  your-project
> Create a new project
? Select project region  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
 DigitalOcean - sgp1 (Singapore)
  HuaWei Cloud - cn-east-3 (Shanghai, China)
  Vultr - ewr1 (New Jersey, United States)
  Google Cloud Platform - asia-east1 (Taipei, Taiwan)
> Amazon Web Services - ap-east-1 (Hong Kong)
  Amazon Web Services - ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo, Japan)
  Amazon Web Services - us-west-1 (California, United States)
? What is the domain of your WordPress website? (For example, if you enter "myapp", the domain will be "myapp.zeabur.app") mywordpressdemo7c918e14
INFO	Domain mywordpressdemo7c918e14.zeabur.app is available!
m
INFO	Template successfully deployed into project "aphylac" (https://dash.zeabur.com/projects/your-project-id).
```

## Publishing Templates Using the `zeabur` CLI

If testing is successful, you can use the `npx zeabur@latest template create` command to publish the template for others to use. For example, using the `wp.yaml` from above:

```
$ npx zeabur@latest template create -f wp.yaml
INFO	Template "WordPress" (https://zeabur.com/templates/71HORL) created
```

It is a one-click command. You can click the link to view the deployed template:

![Deployed template](/template/template-in-code/created-template.webp)

You can also add `.yaml` to the end of link to view the Template's Resource YAML format: `https://zeabur.com/templates/71HORL.yaml`.

## Updating Templates Using the `zeabur` CLI

If you need to modify the template's content, such as renaming the template or updating the Image version, you can update it after modifying the Resource YAML by using the `npx zeabur@latest template update` command:

```
$ npx zeabur@latest template update -c 71HORL -f wp.yaml
INFO	Template updated.
```
