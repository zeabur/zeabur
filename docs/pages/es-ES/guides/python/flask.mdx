# Deploy Flask

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) project on Zeabur.

## Step1: Create Flask Project

You can get the example project from [flask-template](https://github.com/zeabur/flask-template). The Flask example is quite simple. It has a single route that returns a string.

```python
from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Welcome, this is a Flask app deployed on Zeabur"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=os.getenv("PORT", default=5000), host='0.0.0.0')
```

Please note that Zeabur uses environment variable `PORT` to determine which port to forward. You will therefore need to set this environment variable and use `os.getenv` or other ways to configure the port number in your application.

Zeabur uses `python app.py` or `python main.py` to run Python App. So Your project should contain one of these files and include the commands needed to run the Flask application.

Zeabur determines which ports to open based on the environment variable `PORT`.

## Step2: Deploy

Click on **Add new service** button, then choose **Deploy your source code**.

Search for your Flask App repository, click on import, your Flask App will start deploying.

Note that Zeabur uses [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org) as the WSGI production server for running Flask services.
