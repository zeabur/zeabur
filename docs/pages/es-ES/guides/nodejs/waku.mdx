# Deploy Waku

[Waku](https://waku.gg/) is a minimal React framework that supports React Server Components.

Waku means "frame" in Japanese. Waku-Waku means being excited.

This guide will help you to deploy your Waku application in Zeabur.

## Step1: Create Waku App

### Method 1: Bootstrap with Waku CLI

You can create a Waku project with the command below and follow the instructions.

<Callout>
    Minimum requirement: Node.js 18.3.0 or later
</Callout>

```bash
# npm
npm create waku@latest
# yarn
yarn create waku 
# pnpm
pnpm create waku
```

### Method 2: Clone from our template

We've prepared a template for you to get started with Waku: [Waku Template](https://github.com/zeabur/waku-template)

## Step 2: Deploy to Zeabur

Go to [your dashboard of Zeabur](https://dash.zeabur.com) and create a new project if you haven't done so.

Then, click on the `Deploy New Service` button, select deploy from GitHub.

<Callout>
    If it's your first time to deploy from GitHub on Zeabur, you need to configure and install the GitHub application first.
    You can check a more detailed guide [here](/deploy/github).
</Callout>

After select the repository and branch, Zeabur will automatically start building your service.

Zeabur will automatically detect that your service is built with Waku, so you don't have to do any extra configuration. And your deployment will be finished in a few minutes.

## What's next

After the deployment is complete, you may need to configure the domain name for your Waku application.

Open the "Domain" tab in the service page and click on "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](/deploy/domain-binding).
