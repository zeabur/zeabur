# Deploy Spring Boot

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Environment Configuration

You can test and build locally first to make sure your project can run normally.

The JDK version available on Zeabur is as follows:

- 19
- 17 (default)
- 11
- 8
- 7

### Specify JDK Version

You can specify the JDK version in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

For example, if you use Maven, add the following settings in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>11</java.version>
</properties>
```

If you use Gradle, add the following settings in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = 11
```

## Step 2: Create a Project (Optional)

First, you need to initialize a Spring Boot project in your local development environment. We can follow the instructions in the [Spring Boot official document](https://spring.io/quickstart) to complete this step, or initialize a Spring Boot project according to your favorite IDE (such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)).

If you use the **Gradle deployment tool**, you need to open the `build.gradle` file in the Gradle project and add the following settings:

```groovy
jar {
    enabled = false
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'com.example.demo.DemoApplication' // <-- Please replace with your own main class
    }
}
```

After creation, initialize a Git repository for it and deploy it to your Github.

## Step 3: Deploy Spring Boot Project

In your project, click the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button, and select **Deploy your source code**.

Search for the Spring Boot code repository you want to deploy, and click Import. Your Spring Boot application will automatically start deploying.
