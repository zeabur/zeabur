# Deploying PHP apps

Zeabur supports not only traditional multi-file PHP apps with `index.php` as the entry point but also offers one-click deployment for frameworks like [Laravel](./php/laravel), ThinkPHP, CodeIgniter, etc.

## Customizing `php.ini` Settings

Use Zeabur's [config file editor](/deploy/config-edit) to create a configuration file under `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d` with the extension `ini`. You can directly write the PHP settings you wish to override in this file.

For example, if you want to set the maximum file upload size to 100MB, you can create a file `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/upload.ini` with the following content:

```ini
upload_max_filesize = 100M
```

## Customizing NGINX Configuration

Use Zeabur's [config file editor](/deploy/config-edit) to create a configuration file at the path `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`, which overrides the default NGINX configuration on Zeabur.

If you'd like to tweak the NGINX configuration based on the existing configuration, you can download the current NGINX configuration file used by Zeabur from the [zbpack NGINX configuration repository](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/blob/main/internal/php/nginx-conf/default.conf), and make your modifications on that basis. For example, if you wish to disable `gzip` compression, you can change the template's `gzip_static on;` to `gzip_static off;`.

```
server {
    # see https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/blob/main/internal/php/nginx-conf/default.conf

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        gzip_static off;  // disable gzip compression
	}
}
```
