# Deploying PHP apps

Zeabur supports not only traditional multi-file PHP apps with `index.php` as the entry point but also offers one-click deployment for frameworks like [Laravel](./php/laravel), ThinkPHP, CodeIgniter, etc.

## Customizing `php.ini` Settings

Use Zeabur's [config file editor](/deploy/config-edit) to create a configuration file under `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d` with the extension `ini`. You can directly write the PHP settings you wish to override in this file.

For example, if you want to set the maximum file upload size to 100MB, you can create a file `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/upload.ini` with the following content:

```ini
upload_max_filesize = 100M
```
