# Deploy ElysiaJS App

[ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com) is a fast, and friendly Bun web framework.

This documentation is going to show you how to deploy ElysiaJS App in Zeabur withing one minute.

## Step1: Create ElysiaJS App

### Method 1: Bootstrap with Bun

#### Install Bun

Elysia is based on [Bun](https://bun.sh/), so you need to install Bun first.

```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

#### Bootstrap ElysiaJS App

```bash
bun create elysia app-name
```

After that, you will get a ElysiaJS App in `app-name` directory.

```bash
cd app-name
bun run dev
```

Now, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to see the result.

#### Upload to GitHub

If you want to deploy your ElysiaJS App on Zeabur, you need to upload your code to GitHub first.

Just create a new repository on GitHub, and push your code to it, see a more detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

### Method 2: Use Zeabur Template

We've prepared a [template](https://github.com/zeabur/elysia-starter) for ElysiaJS App, you can use the template with click on the **Use this template** button.
