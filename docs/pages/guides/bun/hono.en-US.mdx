# Hono

[Hono](https://hono.dev) (meaning "flame"ðŸ”¥ in Japanese) is a small, simple, and ultra-fast web framework designed for edge devices.

This document will guide you on how to deploy a Hono project on Zeabur.

## Criteria

If your service meets all the following conditions, Zeabur will recognize it as a Hono project and automatically handle the build and deployment:

1. There is a `bun.lockb` file in the project root directory.
2. There is a `package.json` file in the project directory.
3. The `dependencies` field in the `package.json` includes the `hono` package.

If you are interested in contributing to open source, you can find the relevant part in [zbpack's source code](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/tree/main/internal/bun).

## Step One: Initialize the Project

You can follow the steps in the [official Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/getting-started/bun) to initialize a Hono project using Bun.

### Installing Bun

```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Initializing a Hono Project

```bash
bun create hono my-app
```

After creation, you can go to the `my-app` directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd my-app
bun install
```

### Local Testing

```
bun run dev
```

Now, you can visit http://localhost:3000, and you should see `Hello, Bun!`.

## Step Two: Deployment

You can choose one of two ways to deploy your Hono project: using GitHub or using the Zeabur CLI.

### Deploying with Zeabur CLI

Using the Zeabur CLI is the simplest way to deploy your Hono project. You just need to log in to the Zeabur CLI first:

```bash
npx @zeabur/cli auth login
```

This command will open a browser and guide you through the login process.

Next, you can use the `deploy` command to deploy your Hono project:

```bash
npx @zeabur/cli deploy
```

This command will interactively ask you which project you want to deploy to, and you can also choose to create a new project.

For more instructions on deploying using the Zeabur CLI, please see [Deploying Services Using CLI](../deploy/deploy-with-cli).

### Deploying with GitHub

Deploying with GitHub allows your project to enjoy out-of-the-box CI/CD services. In the future, simply push your code to GitHub, and Zeabur will automatically deploy it for you.

Please create a new repository on GitHub and then push your code to the repository. For more detailed instructions, refer to the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

After pushing, click **Deploy service**, then select **Deploy your source code**.

Search for your repository, click to import, and your Hono service will automatically begin deploying.

## Step Three: Configure Domain

Once the deployment is complete, you may need to set up a domain for your Hono site.

Open the "Domain" tab on the service page, then click "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information on how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Domain Binding](../deploy/domain-binding).
