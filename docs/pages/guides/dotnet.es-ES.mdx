# Deploy .NET App

Zeabur supports .NET (Core) projects that can be run on a Linux machine. The following frameworks are supported:

* .NET (Console)
* ASP.NET Core
* ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly

## Monorepo

Zeabur supports projects organized in the following structure (the name is not important):

```plain
- YourProject.sln
- YourLibrary1
    - YourLibrary1.csproj
- YourLibrary2
    - YourLibrary2.csproj
- YourBackend
    - YourBackend.csproj
- YourFrontend
    - YourFrontend.csproj
```

However, you may need to specify the directory that contains the project you want to deploy with the environment variable `ZBPACK_DOTNET_SUBMODULE_DIR` or the `dotnet.submodule_dir` configuration in `zbpack.json`. For example, if you want to deploy the `YourBackend` project, set the environment variable `ZBPACK_DOTNET_SUBMODULE_DIR` to `YourBackend` or add the following to your `zbpack.json` file in the root directory of your project:

```json
{
    "dotnet": {
        "submodule_dir": "YourBackend"
    }
}
```
