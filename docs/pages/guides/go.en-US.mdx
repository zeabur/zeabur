# Deploy Go App

All projects based on [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) can be deployed. But you need to have a `main.go` in the project root directory as the program compilation entry.

## Custom Application Entry Point

If you have multiple entry points, you need to place them in the `cmd` directory, such as a `cmd/server-a/main.go` and a `cmd/server-b/main.go`.

Zeabur will automatically recognize and deploy the application in the `cmd` directory that matches the service name.

## Setting Pre-build Commands

If your Go project requires running commands like `go generate` before building, you can set them using the `ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND` environment variable.

```env
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=go generate ./...
```

You can also set the `build_command` in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "build_command": "go generate ./..."
}
```

Your pre-build commands will run after dependencies are installed and before the build process.

## Enabling cgo

If your Go project needs to use cgo, you can set `cgo` in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "cgo": true
}
```

Or set the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable:

```env
CGO_ENABLED=1
```

Zeabur will automatically enable cgo and install the necessary C/C++ toolchain.

## Listen on Port

Zeabur will automatically set the `PORT` environment variable for the Go program to listen on.

```go
port := os.Getenv("PORT")
if port == "" {
    port = "8080"
}

http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil)
```

## Serverless Support

Zeabur supports deploying Go as a serverless project. However, it currently requires opt-in.
Please refer to the [Enable Serverless](/deploy/serverless) page to enable serverless support.
