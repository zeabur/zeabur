# Deploy Go App

All projects based on [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) can be deployed. But you need to have a `main.go` in the project root directory as the program compilation entry.

If you have multiple program compilation entries, you need to put them in the `cmd` directory, for example, a `cmd/server-a/main.go` and a `cmd/server-b/main.go`.

Zeabur will automatically recognize and deploy the program compilation entry with the same Service name under the `cmd` directory.

## Listen on Port

Zeabur will automatically set the `PORT` environment variable for the Go program to listen on.

```go
port := os.Getenv("PORT")
if port == "" {
    port = "8080"
}

http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil)
```

## Serverless Support

Zeabur supports deploying Go as a serverless project. However, it currently requires opt-in.
Please refer to the [Enable Serverless](/deploy/serverless) page to enable serverless support.
