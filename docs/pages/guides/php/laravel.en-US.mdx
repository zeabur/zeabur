# Deploy Laravel

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) project on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Environment Configuration

You can test and build locally first to make sure your project can run normally. You must apply your PHP version in composer.json for Zeabur to deploy.
```json
{
  "require": {
        "php": "8.1"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Create a Project (Optional)

First, you need to initialize a Laravel project in your local development environment. We can follow the instructions in the [Laravel official document](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x) to complete this step

After creation, initialize a Git repository for it and deploy it to your GitHub.

## Step 3: Deploy Laravel Project

In your project, click the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button, and select **Deploy your source code**.

Search for the Laravel Boot code repository you want to deploy, and click Import.
Your Laravel Boot application will automatically start deploying.

## Step 4: Add an `APP_KEY` for you Laravel project

Generating an application key or APP_KEY is one of the most important initial steps every time a Laravel developer creates or clones a Laravel application.

Switch to project variable setting page and enter your environment parameter.

You can generate a `APP_KEY` by enter this command under your Laravel project:

```shell
php artisan key:generate
```

## Connect to MySQL Database

Typically, your Laravel project will need to connect to a MySQL database.
You can connect to a MySQL database using the following steps.

1. You need to first install the `ext-pdo_mysql` extension on your Laravel project so that Zeabur can enable MySQL PHP support for you. Install this extension in your local environment using the following command:

    ```shell
    composer require ext-pdo_mysql
    ```

    Then commit the new `composer.json` and lock files and push them to your GitHub repository.

2. [Create a MySQL service](/marketplace/mysql) and then, in your local environment, run the following command to migrate your tables to Zeabur:

    ```shell
    export DATABASE_URL=mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
    php artisan migrate
    ```

    The `<username>`, `<password>`, `<host>`, `<port>`, and `<database>` mentioned above are your MySQL service details,
    which you can find in the "Instruction" section of the MySQL service page.

3. On your Zeabur Laravel service page, set a DATABASE_URL environment variable with the following content:

    ```
    mysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE}
    ```

    The meanings of `${MYSQL_USER}` and other variables can be found in the [MySQL documentation's environment variable section](/marketplace/mysql#environment-variables).

## Laravel Octane Support

Zeabur comes with built-in support for Laravel Octane with Swoole server, but you need to set the server to use in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
  "laravel": {
    "octane": {
      "server": "swoole"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use the `ZBPACK_LARAVEL_OCTANE_SERVER=swoole` environment variable to set Laravel Octane for each services.
