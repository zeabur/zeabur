# MkDocs

MkDocs is a fast, simple, and extremely elegant static site generator specifically designed for building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured through a single YAML configuration file.

## Demo Video

Below is a demo video showing how to initialize and deploy a MkDocs project on Zeabur in 60 seconds.

## Criteria

If your project meets the following criteria, Zeabur will recognize it as a MkDocs project and deploy it automatically:

1. There is a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file in the project root directory.

If you are interested in contributing to open source, you can find the relevant part in [zbpack's open-source code](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/tree/main/internal/static).

## Get Started Immediately

This article will guide you on how to initialize a MkDocs project and deploy it on Zeabur.

### Initialize the Project

You can refer to the [MkDocs official documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) to initialize your MkDocs project.

```bash
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
```

### Local Testing

You can test your MkDocs project locally.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to preview your MkDocs project.

### Deployment

You can choose two ways to deploy your MkDocs project: using GitHub or using the Zeabur CLI.

#### Deploying with Zeabur CLI

Deploying with the Zeabur CLI is the simplest way to deploy your MkDocs project. First, log in to the Zeabur CLI:

```bash
npx @zeabur/cli auth login
```

This command will open a browser and guide you through the login process.

Then, you can use the `deploy` command to deploy:

```bash
npx @zeabur/cli deploy
```

This command will ask you interactively which project you want to deploy to, or you can choose to create a new project.

For more instructions on deploying with the Zeabur CLI, please see [Deploying Services with CLI](../deploy/deploy-with-cli).

#### Deploying with GitHub

Deploying with GitHub allows your project to enjoy out-of-the-box CI/CD services. Simply push the code to GitHub, and Zeabur will automatically deploy it for you.

Create a new repository on GitHub, then push the code to the repository. For more detailed instructions, refer to [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

After pushing, click **Deploy service**, then select **Deploy your source code**.

Search for your repository, click import, and your service will automatically start deploying.

### Setting Up a Domain

After deployment is complete, you need to set up a domain for your website.

Open the "Domains" tab on the service page, then click "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain".

For more information on how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Binding Domains](../deploy/domain-binding).
