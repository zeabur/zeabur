# Deploying Node.js App

Zeabur supports various types of Node.js projects:

- Native projects (supporting NPM/Yarn/PNPM/Bun and other package managers)
- Projects bundled with [Vite](./nodejs/vite)
- [Qwik](./nodejs/qwik)
- [Next.js](./nodejs/nextjs)
- [Remix](./nodejs/remix)
- [Nuxt.js](./nodejs/nuxtjs)
- [Umi](./nodejs/umi)
- [Svelte (Kit)](./nodejs/svelte-kit)
- [Nest.js](./nodejs/nestjs)
- [Nue.js](./nodejs/nuejs)
- [Express](./nodejs/express)
- [Astro](./nodejs/astro)
- [Waku](./nodejs/waku)
- [Nue](./nodejs/nue)
- Create React App
- vue-cli
- Hexo
- Vitepress
- Astro (static, SSR)
- Slidev
- Docusaurus
- Solid Start (Node, static)

## Monorepo Support

Zeabur will automatically recognize [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), [Yarn Workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces), and most toolchains based on these two Monorepo approaches, such as Turborepo and Lerna.

Take the `basic` template of Turborepo as an example, its `pnpm-workspace.yaml` content is as follows:

```yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

Under `apps`, there are two directories, `docs` and `web`. By default, Zeabur will select the first Node.js application listed in the workspace package list to deploy. In this case, Zeabur will deploy the application under `apps/docs`. If you want to deploy `apps/web`, you can create a `zbpack.json` file in the root directory of the project and add the following content:

```json
{
    "app_dir": "apps/web"
}
```

Or use [environment variables](/deploy/variables) to set it:

```env
ZBPACK_APP_DIR=apps/web
```

This will deploy the `apps/web` application.

<Callout type="info">
    [Nx](https://nx.dev) and [Rush](https://rushjs.io), which are not based on the above two Monorepo approaches, are not yet supported for one-click deployment. You can refer to "Disable Cache Functionality" and "Modifying Build and Start Commands" to configure Monorepo.
</Callout>

## Disabling Cache Functionality

By default, Zeabur rearranges the installation process to speed up your CI/CD by recording the steps of dependency installation. This should not affect most Node.js projects, but if your project needs to use other files in the project during dependency installation which leads to a project compilation failure, you may need to disable the caching feature.

To disable this feature, create a `zbpack.json` file in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

```json
{
    "cache_dependencies": false
}
```

Or set [environment variables](/deploy/variables):

```env
ZBPACK_CACHE_DEPENDENCIES=false
```

## Modifying Build and Start Commands

If your project type is more specialized (such as using a custom Monorepo toolchain), you may need to specify the build and start commands for the service, for example, change the start command of the `frontend` service to `pnpm run start:frontend`; change the build command of the `api` service to `pnpm run start:api`.

Here are two ways to modify these commands.

### Modifying in the Web Interface

After deploying your project to the Zeabur service, expand the "Settings" section to modify the "Custom Build Command" and "Custom Start Command". After making the changes, click "Redeploy" to deploy the project again.

![Node.js: Custom Command](/guides/nodejs/custom-command.png)

### Modifying via Files

Add the following two settings to `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
    "build_command": "<custom build command>",
    "start_command": "<custom start command>"
}
```

The default settings in `zbpack.json` will be applied to all deployed services. If you want to specify different commands for different services (e.g., use a specific command for a service named `api` and another command for a service named `frontend`), you need to create a file named `zbpack.[service name].json`:

```json
// zbpack.api.json
{
    "build_command": "pnpm run build:api",
    "start_command": "pnpm run start:api"
}
```

```json
// zbpack.frontend.json
{
    "build_command": "pnpm run build:frontend",
    "start_command": "pnpm run start:frontend"
}
```

The priority of applying the settings is `zbpack.[service name].json` > `zbpack.json`.

### Modify Using Environment Variables

You can also use [environment variables](/deploy/variables) to set the build and start commands:

```env
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=pnpm run build:api
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND=pnpm run start:api
```

## Configure Node.js Version and Package Manager Version

### Node.js Version

By default, Zeabur uses the latest LTS version of Node.js to build your project.

If you want to use a different version, you can specify it in your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "engines": {
        "node": "18.1.0"
    }
}
```

### Package Manager Version

By default, Zeabur uses yarn to install dependencies for your project. If you want to use a different package manager, you can specify it in your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "packageManager": "pnpm@8.0.0"
}
```

## Deploying in Serverless Mode

If your Node.js project meets the following criteria, you can deploy it in Serverless mode on Zeabur:

1. Project is built with frameworks designed for Serverless deployment, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), etc.
2. The Project does not use the above frameworks, but the service itself meets the concept of Serverless: the state of each request is independent of each other, and can automatically sleep when there is no request.

### Enable Serverless

If your project is written using Next.js, Nuxt.js, Waku, Angular, and Remix
([a complete list can be found in the `getServerless` function of `zeabur/zbpack` repository](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack/blob/main/internal/nodejs/plan.go)),
Zeabur will automatically deploy the project in serverless form.
If you need to disable this, please refer to the [Enable Serverless](/deploy/serverless) chapter.

For projects written in other frameworks (or you build your serverless function manually),
opting in is currently required.
Please refer to the [Enable Serverless](/deploy/serverless) page to enable serverless support.
If there are no issues during testing, feel free to submit a Pull Request to the
[zbpack code repository](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack) for supporting your framework.

### Building Project in Serverless Format

If your project uses frameworks such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, Remix, etc., you can skip this step
because [zbpack](https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack) will automatically convert it to Serverless format.

However, if your project does not use the above frameworks,
you need to build your project into [Serverless format](../advanced/serverless-output-format) yourself.
Here is an example of a basic Express.js application:

```js
// app.js

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!')
})

module.exports = app
```

In the above example, you can see that the `app.js` module has already exported the `app` object, which is an object that conforms to the Serverless processing function format of Zeabur. Therefore, all we have to do is to output it to the `index.func` directory under `.zeabur/output/functions` during the build phase.

To achieve this, we can add the following script to the code:

```js
// scripts/build.js

const esbuild = require('esbuild');
const fs = require('fs');

// dynamic-required files
const dynamicRequiredDirs = ['views']

// static files
const staticFileDirs = ['public']

// Remove old output
if (fs.existsSync('.zeabur/output')) {
    console.info('Removing old .zeabur/output')
    fs.rmSync('.zeabur/output', {recursive: true})
}

function getModuleEntries() {
    function getModuleEntriesRecursive(dir) {
        let entries = []
        fs.readdirSync(dir).forEach(file => {
            const path = `${dir}/${file}`
            if (fs.statSync(path).isDirectory()) {
                if(file === 'node_modules') return
                entries = entries.concat(getModuleEntriesRecursive(path))
            } else if (file.endsWith('.js')) {
                entries.push(path)
            }
        })
        return entries
    }
    return getModuleEntriesRecursive('.')
}

// build with esbuild
try {
    esbuild.build({
        entryPoints: getModuleEntries(),
        bundle: false,
        minify: false,
        outdir: '.zeabur/output/functions/index.func',
        platform: 'node',
        target: 'node20',
        plugins: [{
            name: 'make-all-packages-external',
            setup(build) {
                let filter = /^[^.\/]|^\.[^.\/]|^\.\.[^\/]/ // Must not start with "/" or "./" or "../"
                build.onResolve({filter}, args => ({path: args.path, external: true}))
            },
        }],
    }).then(res => {
        if (res.errors.length > 0) {
            console.error(res.errors)
            process.exit(1)
        }
        console.info('Successfully built app.js into .zeabur/output/functions/index.func')
        fs.copyFileSync('.zeabur/output/functions/index.func/app.js', '.zeabur/output/functions/index.func/index.js')
        fs.rmSync('.zeabur/output/functions/index.func/app.js')
    })
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
}

// copy node_modules into function output directory
console.info('Copying node_modules into .zeabur/output/functions/index.func/node_modules')
fs.cpSync('node_modules', '.zeabur/output/functions/index.func/node_modules', {recursive: true, verbatimSymlinks: true})

// copy package.json into function output directory
console.info('Copying package.json into .zeabur/output/functions/index.func')
fs.cpSync('package.json', '.zeabur/output/functions/index.func/package.json')

// copy dynamic-required files into function output directory, so they can be required during runtime
dynamicRequiredDirs.forEach(dir => {
    copyIfDirExists(dir, `.zeabur/output/functions/index.func/${dir}`)
})

// copy static files into function output directory, so they can be served by the web server directly
staticFileDirs.forEach(dir => {
    copyIfDirExists(dir, `.zeabur/output/static`)
})

function copyIfDirExists(src, dest) {
    if (fs.statSync(src).isDirectory()) {
        console.info(`Copying ${src} to ${dest}`)
        fs.cp(src, dest, {recursive: true}, (err) => {
            if (err) throw err;
        });
        return
    }
    console.warn(`${src} is not a directory`)
}
```

This script does a straightforward thing, it uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to build your project, then puts all `.js` files into the `.zeabur/output/functions/index.func` directory according to the original relative path, and copies `node_modules` and `package.json` to the `.zeabur/output/functions/index.func` directory, so that the project is built.

Note in particular that we have retained two special configurable fields in this script:

```js
// dynamic-required files
const dynamicRequiredDirs = ['views']

// static files
const staticFileDirs = ['public']
```

These two fields allow us to put things other than `.js` into the output, where `dynamicRequiredDirs` is a file that is only required at runtime, such as a template file in the `views` directory; `staticFileDirs` is a static file, such as a static resource in the `public` directory, which is placed in the `.zeabur/output/static` directory so that they can be distributed to users around the world by the Zeabur Edge Network at a faster speed.

Don't forget to install `esbuild` in your project after adding this script, and add the `build` command to the `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "node scripts/build.js"
    }
}
```

You can find the complete sample code at [zeabur/expressjs-template](https://github.com/zeabur/expressjs-template) or modify the `scripts/build.js` script according to your needs.

## Additional Notes

1.  You should get the port to listen from `process.env.PORT`.

    For example:

    ```js
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
    // instead of const port = 3000
    ```

2.  Avoid using nodemon as runtime. Execute your command with general `node` command in production.

    For example, in `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node server.js"
            // instead of "start": "nodemon server.js"
        }
    }
    ```
