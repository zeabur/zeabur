# Deploy Python Projects

Zeabur supports various types of Python projects, including:

- [Flask](./python/flask)
- [Django](./python/django)
- FastAPI

If your source code includes `app.py`, `main.py`, or similar entry points, Zeabur will also start automatically.

## Serverless

Zeabur supports deploying Python projects as serverless projects. However, this currently requires opt-in.
Please refer to the [Enable Serverless](/deploy/serverless) page to enable your serverless support.
