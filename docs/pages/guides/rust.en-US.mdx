# Deploying Rust Projects

Zeabur supports most types of Rust applications - by default, it finds and runs the executable file automatically;
however, you can also specify which executable file to run in the "Service Name" field.

If you don't currently have a Rust project and want to try it, feel free to fork
[zeabur/axum-template](https://github.com/zeabur/axum-template) to your GitHub account and deploy it on Zeabur.

## Supported project types

- Single-executable projects: Rust project with just one `src/main.rs` entry point.
  Zeabur finds the only executable artifact in the `target/release` directory.
  Also, it is acceptable to fill in the "Service Name" field with
  the artifact filename to execute to ensure Zeabur runs what you want.
- Multi-executable projects: Rust project with two or more entry points, including `src/main.rs`
  and other files in `src/bin`. You may need to fill in the "Service Name" field with
  the artifact filename to execute.
- Cargo Workspace mono-repo: Rust project with multiple crates. You may need to fill
  in the "Service Name" field with the artifact filename to execute.

When the executable filename you wrote did not hit, Zeabur will try to find the executable file automatically.
Zeabur scans all the files in `target/release` and runs the first executable file it found.
Since this pattern is easy to guess wrong in complex scenarios (such as Multi-executable projects
and Cargo Workspace mono-repo), it is recommended that you fill in the correct "Service Name".
Refer to "Find artifact filename" for more information.

## Find artifact filename

The artifact can be found in the directory `target/release` of your project. To do this:

1. You need the Rust toolchain to compile the project. Download it on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org).
2. Clone the project you want to deploy and change to the project directory.
3. Run `cargo build --release` to compile the project.

    ```bash
    $ cargo run --release
    Compiling zeabur v0.1.0 (/project)
      Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.65s
      Running `target/release/zeabur`
    ```

4. Find the line starting with "Running", and we pick the base (trailing) name
   of the following path (`target/release/zeabur`). For this case, it is `zeabur`.
5. Fill `zeabur` to the "Service Name" field.

## Copy other files

If your application depends on other files or directories in the source code repository
in addition to the executable file. For example:

```plain
*public
|`-- public <-- Your application depends on this folder
|``-- src
|-- main.rs
|``-- Cargo.toml
|``-- Cargo.lock
`-- config.toml <-- Your application depends on this file
```

Zeabur allows you preserving them with the file `.zeabur-preserve`. Fill the file
and directories you want to preserve to this file. The directories can optionally end with `/`.
An example is as follows:

```plain
public/
config.toml
```

## Technical details and considerations

- The Rust image is based on Multi-Stage Build, and the runtime uses
  `docker.io/library/debian:bookworm-slim` as the base image. Some
  dynamic libraries may not work properly in the runtime due to the
  lack of some specific packages. For this case, please open a ticket
  about adding support for this package.
  - We currently install `openssl` in the runtime environment.
- No `root` at runtime. Bring your Dockerfile if you need it.
- We use `lld` to speed up compilation. If your project does not support `lld`,
  we recommend that you specify `config.toml` in your project to call the standard `ld`.
  If you want to use a non-built-in linker such as `mold`, you need to write your own Dockerfile.
- We use `cargo-chef` to maximize the cache of build layers. If you encounter
  any incompatible problems, please report them to Zeabur or upstream
  [`LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef).
