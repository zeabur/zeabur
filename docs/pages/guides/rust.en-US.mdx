# Deploying Rust Applications

Zeabur supports all types of Rust applications in principleâ€”it will automatically look for executables by default. If your project has multiple executables, you can specify the executable file name in the "Service Name" field (or use `ZBPACK_RUST_ENTRY`).

If you don't have a project on hand, you can fork the [zeabur/axum-template](https://github.com/zeabur/axum-template) repository to your GitHub account and try deploying it on Zeabur.

## Supported Project Types

- Single Executable Project: A Rust project with only `src/main.rs` as the entry point. Zeabur will automatically find the first executable produced after `cargo install`.
- Multiple Executables Project: If your project has other executables in `src/bin` besides `src/main.rs`, specify the name of the final artifact you want to run in the "Service Name" field or configure it in `zbpack.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rust": {
      "entry": "your-entry"
    }
  }
  ```
  You can also use the environment variable `ZBPACK_RUST_ENTRY` to achieve the same effect.
- Cargo Workspace Monorepo: If your project consists of multiple crates, specify the name of the final artifact you want to run in the "Service Name" field. By default, `cargo install` will install **all projects** under the workspace. Besides using the above `ZBPACK_RUST_ENTRY` method to specify the executable name, you can also directly specify the location of this application workspace in `zbpack.json`. If your application is in the `rest-api` folder at the repository root directory, you can configure it as follows:
  ```json
  {
    "rust": {
      "app_dir": "rest-api"
    }
  }
  ```
  You can also use the environment variable `ZBPACK_RUST_APP_DIR` to achieve the same effect.

If the specified executable does not exist, it will default to auto-detection mode. "Auto-detection" will look for all compiled executables and run the first found file. Because this mode can easily guess wrong in multi-project scenarios, it's recommended to specify the correct "Service Name" for more complex project scenarios. Check the following section for how to find and specify it.

## Finding the Final Artifact Name

The final artifact can be found in `target/release` of your project. To find the filename:

1. You need the Rust toolchain to compile the project. Download it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org).
2. Clone the project you want to deploy and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `cargo build --release` to compile the project.

    ```bash
    $ cargo run --release
    Compiling zeabur v0.1.0 (/project)
      Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.65s
      Running `target/release/zeabur`
    ```

4. Find the line Running `target/release/zeabur`, extract the final executable name (zeabur).
5. Fill in `zeabur` in the Service Name or `ZBPACK_RUST_ENTRY`.

## Copying Other Files

If your project relies on other files in the codebase besides the executable. For example:

```plain
*
|`-- public  <-- Your program depends on this folder
|`-- src
|  `-- main.rs
|`-- Cargo.toml
|`-- Cargo.lock
`--- config.toml   <-- Your program depends on this file
```

You can specify `rust.assets` in `zbpack.json`, listing the folders or files you want to keep. Folders should end with `/`. Example:

```json
{
  "rust": {
    "assets": [
      "public/",
      "config.toml"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Custom Build and Start Commands

Zeabur provides "build command", "start command", and "pre-start command" in Rust, allowing you to insert necessary dependencies or write necessary files at various stages of your Rust project's build process.

  BC -->|Compile Software| S((Runtime Stage))
  S --> PSC[Pre-Start Command]
  PSC -->|Build Complete| D((Deployment))
  D --> SC[Start Command]
  SC --> R((Start))
```

### Build Command

You can use `ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND` to specify **commands to run before compiling**, for example:

```
ZBPACK_BUILD_COMMAND=sudo apt install sqlite3
```

You can also specify this in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
  "build_command": "sudo apt install sqlite3"
}
```

### Start Command

You can use `ZBPACK_START_COMMAND` to override the default start command specified by Zeabur, for example:

```
ZBPACK_START_COMMAND="/app/server --debug"
```

You can also specify this in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
  "start_command": "/app/server --debug"
}
```

### Pre-Start Command

If you need to install some dependencies before starting, you can use `ZBPACK_PRE_START_COMMAND` to specify the command to run before execution:

```
ZBPACK_PRE_START_COMMAND="sudo apt install sqlite3"
```

You can also specify this in `zbpack.json`:

```json
{
  "pre_start_command": "sudo apt install sqlite3"
}
```

Compared to `ZBPACK_START_COMMAND`, the content will persist and won't be re-executed each time the system restarts, resulting in faster startup.

### Automatic Dependency Installation

If your project depends on OpenSSL and explicitly specifies it in `Cargo.toml` (or indirectly depends on it via `Cargo.lock`), Zeabur will automatically install the `openssl` runtime library.

## Runtime Environment

Zeabur currently uses [`rust:1-silm`](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) as the runtime image. Your executable will be placed in the `/app` directory, with `/` (root directory) as the working directory.

Files in `rust.assets` will be placed in the `/app` directory, which is the same directory as the executable file. If you need to read assets, in practice, you usually read files from a **path relative to the executable**. The following example will get the location of your `images` asset.

```rust
use std::env;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let exe_path = env::current_exe().expect("Failed to get current executable path");
    let exe_dir = exe_path.parent().expect("Failed to get executable directory");
    let relative_path = exe_dir.join("images");

    println!("config.toml path: {:?}", relative_path);
}
```

Note that for configuration files, **it is usually retrieved from the working directory**. Since the working directory is the root directory, you should place your config in `/config.toml` (instad of `/app/config.toml`) when adding a configuration file using Config Editor. After that, read the file from the working directory:

```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let current_dir = env::current_dir()?;
    let config_path: PathBuf = current_dir.join("config.toml");

    // It is recommended to use serde for deserialization. This is just a demo, so read_to_string is used here.
    let mut file = File::open(config_path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    println!("Config file contents:\n{}", contents);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Serverless Deployment

Unlike other PaaS platforms that run your Rust application inside a Docker container directly, Zeabur also supports deploying Rust applications using the [Serverless deployment](/deploy/serverless) method. This allows your Rust application to start only when it receives a request, instead of running continuously like a container, saving resources.

To deploy a Rust application using Serverless, add `ZBPACK_SERVERLESS=1` to the environment variables.
