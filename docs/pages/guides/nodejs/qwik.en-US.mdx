# Deploy Qwik Project

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io) project on Zeabur.

## Initialize Project

First, you need to initialize a Qwik project in your local development environment. We can follow the instructions in the [Qwik official documentation](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/getting-started/) to complete this step.

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

After following the instructions to complete the initialization, you should see something like the following:

```bash
💫 Let's create a Qwik app 💫

✔ Project name … qwik-app
✔ Select a starter › Basic

🦄  Success!  Project created in portfolio directory

🐰 Next steps:
   cd qwik-app
   npm install
   npm start

💬 Integration? Add Netlify, Cloudflare, Tailwind...:
   npm run qwik add

```

And you will see a `qwik-app` folder created in your current directory.

## Develop

After initialization, you can switch to the `qwik-app` folder and run `npm start` to start the development server.

```bash
cd qwik-app
npm start
```

You should see something like the following:

```bash
 VITE v3.1.1  ready in 140 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Next, you can start modifying the code to develop your Qwik project.

## Install Adaptor Package

In order to run your Qwik project on Zeabur, you need to install the Qwik Node.js (Express) adaptor package before deployment.

```bash
npm run qwik add express
```

After installation, you should see something like the following:

```text
🦄  Success!  Added express to your app

## Test Build Locally

After installing the adaptor package, you can first test the build locally to make sure your project runs properly.

```bash
npm run build
```

If your code has no problems, you should see two new folders, `dist` and `server`, added to the project directory.

Next, try entering the following command to start the local server:

```bash
node server/entry.express.js
```

Next, try entering `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the page running smoothly:

## Deploy

After confirming that the local test build has no problems, you can create a code repository on GitHub and push the current code up.

Finally, go back to the project page of your project on Zeabur, click the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button, and select **Deploy your source code**.

Search for the code repository you just created, and click `import`, and your Qwik application will automatically start deploying.

After deployment, you can refer to the [Binding Domain](..//deploy/domain-binding) document to learn how to bind a public domain name that can be accessed externally to your Qwik project.
