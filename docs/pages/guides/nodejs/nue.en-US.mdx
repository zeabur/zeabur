# Deploy Nue App

[Nue](https://nuejs.org/) is a powerful React, Vue, Next.js, Vite, and Astro alternative. It might change the way you develop for the web.

This documentation is going to show you how to deploy Nue App in Zeabur withing one minute.

## Step1: Create Nue App

### Method 1: Bootstrap with `create-nue`

`create-nue` repository is the best way to get started with Nue JS.

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nuejs/create-nue.git

# cd to your newly created app
cd create-nue

# install dependencies
npm install

# Build demo site and start a HTTP server
npm run start

# Open the demo on the browser
open "http://localhost:8080"
```

#### Upload to GitHub

If you want to deploy your Nue App on Zeabur, you need to upload your code to GitHub first.

Just create a new repository on GitHub, and push your code to it, see a more detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

### Method 2: Use Zeabur Template
