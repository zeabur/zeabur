# Verify Your Account

Zeabur offers a priority support for all the verified users.

Your verifaication can help us target your problems and solve them faster. You may also get some credits as a reward for you activity in our Discord server.

## How to Get Verified

We use our Discord bot **Zebra** to help us with the verification process.

### Step 1: Join Our Discord Server

First of all, you need to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/DrdGCvXEyY). You can communicate with our staff and other users there, and post your feedbacks and problems.

### Step 2: Link Your Account

When you get into our Discord server, you will see a welcome message from Zebra. You will find a [verify channel](https://discord.com/channels/1060209568820494336/1095916895649153094) in the message content.

## What's Next

After your verifaication is done, you can get a priority support from our team. And when you upgrade to another plan, **Zebra** will automatically give you a special role in our Discord server. You can join some priority channels with that role.
