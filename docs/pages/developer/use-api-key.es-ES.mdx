# Introduction

You can interact with our GraphQL API / REST API by sending HTTP requests in any language. Before using it, you need to create an API Key in the [Dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com).

# Creating API Key

In [Dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com/), click on `Settings` in the dropdown menu on the right, then click on `Developer` in the sidebar on the left to see the developer options.

Find the `API Key` area, and click the `Generate New Token` button to generate an API Key.

Click the `View` button to view the API Key.

Click the `Copy` button to copy the API Key.

# Using API Key

## Authentication

Zeabur API can optionally use the API Key for authentication. Ensure you have generated a valid API Key.

All API requests should include your API Key in the `Authorization` HTTP header as shown below:

```http
Authorization: Bearer ZEABUR_API_KEY
```

# Sending a REST API Request

You can use any HTTP client library or within your application to send requests. Here is an example:

You can paste the following command into the terminal to run your first REST API request. Be sure to replace `$ZEABUR_API_KEY` with your API Key:

```bash
curl https://gateway.zeabur.com/api/v1/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZEABUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

This queries the current user's information. You should receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "_id": "64ffffffffffffffffff",
    "name": "Zeabur Zebra",
    "email": "zebra@zeabur.com",
    "username": "zeabra",
    "language": "en-US",
    "githubID": 5000000,
    "avatarUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5000000?v=4",
    "createdAt": "2023-08-31T08:14:08.873Z",
    "bannedAt": null,
    "bannedReason": null,
    "emailPreference": {
        "buildFailed": true,
        "deploymentCrashed": true
    },
    "agreedAt": "2023-08-31T08:14:17.028Z",
    "referralCode": "zeabra",
    "discordID": "7000000000000000000",
    "customerID": "cus_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Now that you have successfully authenticated with the API Key, you can use the API Key to access other REST APIs.

The access method for the GrapQL API is the same as above, but the request method is different. You can try the GraphQL API in the [GraphQL Playground](https://gateway.zeabur.com/graphql).
