# Referral

Zeabur offers a referral program to all users. You can invite your friends to join Zeabur and earn credits.

Once your friend signs up using your referral link, when they upgrade to a paid plan, you will receive US$ 5 credits in your account.

## How to invite friends

First of all, you need a referral link to invite your friends. You can find your referral link in the [Referral](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/referral) page.

Copy your referral link, and share it with your friends. You can share it via email, social media, or any other way you like.

## How to check your credits

You can check your credits in the [Referral](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/referral) page.

As you can see, there are two sections of referral status in this page. One is **Pending**, which means your friend has signed up using your referral link, but has not upgraded to a paid plan yet. The other is **Credited**, which means your friend has upgraded to a paid plan, and you have received the credits.

## How to use your credits

Your credits will be automatically used to pay for your subscription with the highest priority. If you have enough credits, you will not be charged for the subscription.
