# Subscription

## What is Subscription?

There are 3 types of plans on Zeabur: **Serverless Plan**, **Developer Plan** and **Team Plan**.
You can check the details of each plan on [plans](/billing/plans) page.

If you has not subscribed to any plan, you'll be considered as a **Serverless Plan** user by default.

## How to Subscribe?

Zeabur's subscription is based on [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

There are 2 ways to subscribe to a plan: **Credit Card** and **Prepaid Credits**.

### Subscribe with Credit Card

You can subscribe to a plan with your credit card, paying in USD.

- Setup without subscription: Go to [billing page](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/billing), you can setup your credit card in **Payment Method** section. After you've input your credit card information, click **Add** button to save your credit card, then you can simply click **Subscribe** button in [plan page](https://dash.zeabur.com/update-plan) to update your subscription.
- Setup with subscription: Go to the [plan page](https://dash.zeabur.com/update-plan) in dashboard, choose a plan, and then input your credit card information, click **Subscribe** button, you'll be redirected to Stripe's checkout page, fill the form and you'll be subscribed to the plan with your credit card saved.

### Subscribe with Prepaid Credits

If you don't have a credit card that is compatible with Stripe service, you can subscribe to a plan with buying some credits.

Go to the [billing page](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/billing) in dashboard, press the **Get More Credits** button to buy some credits, then you can go to the [plan page](https://dash.zeabur.com/update-plan) in dashboard to upgrade your plan with the credits you've bought.

## How to Change Payment Method 

If your card is declined or you want to change your payment method, you can do it in the [billing page](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/billing).

Scroll down to find the **Unbind Payment Method** to unbind current credit card, then you can setup a new credit card.

## How to Downgrade to Serverless Plan

If you've subscribed to a paid plan, you can downgrade to **Serverless Plan** at any time.

Go to [billing page in your dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com/account/billing), scroll down to the danger zone for unsubscribing.

    By downgrading to the Serverless Plan, you will no longer incur any charges. However, your currently deployed Containerized services will be automatically suspended by the system.
