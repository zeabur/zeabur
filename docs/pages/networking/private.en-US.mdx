# Private Networking

Private Networking allows services to use a fixed hostname to connect to another service in the same project.

## Find the Hostname

Open the "Networking" section of the service to find the hostname under "Private."

![find hostname](/networking/private/find-hostname.webp)

## Connect to the Service

Use the hostname above to connect to this service (in this example, PostgreSQL). Additionally, according to [the documentation of PostgreSQL](/marketplace/postgresql), the port is injected into the `POSTGRES_PORT` environment variable. So, you can fill in your connection information as follows:

- Hostname: The hostname you found in the previous step, in this example, it is `postgresql.zeabur.internal`.
- Port: Retrieve the value from the `POSTGRES_PORT` environment variable, which is [defaulted to 5432](https://github.com/zeabur/zeabur/blob/bd565389cf1868a917333d0f74003b4aad6ef0ce/prebuilts/postgresql.toml#L14).

## Important Notes

- Changing the service name does **not** change the hostname.
