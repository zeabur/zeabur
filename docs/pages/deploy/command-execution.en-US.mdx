# Execute Commands

You can execute commands within Zeabur services for installing packages, running programs, viewing information, or even backing up specific data.

## Open the Command Execution Interface

Open the service, open the menu next to “Logs”, and click “Command” to open the interface.

The command execution interface consists of two parts:

- Command Input Bar: Allows you to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click the <kbd>⏎</kbd> button next to the input field to execute commands.
- Command Output Area: Displays the results of the command execution. If the command executes successfully, the output result will be displayed; otherwise, an error code will be shown.

## Execute Commands

Taking a basic `echo` as an example, enter `echo Hello, World!` and you should see the output result `Hello, World!`.

Entering a non-existent command will display an error code.

You can even execute SQL statements in database containers like MySQL or PostgreSQL, use cURL to upload logs or back up files, or even run migration programs (e.g., `prisma migrate`, `node seeder.js`).

For MySQL, we can copy the “Command to connect to your MySQL” command, delete the `host` and `port` parameters (no need for remote connection within the container), rewrite `mysqlsh` to `mysql` (since `mysqlsh` is not available in the container), and finally add `-e` to execute the SQL statement.

```bash
mysql --user=root --password=<password> --database=zeabur -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

## Display Error Messages

If your command fails to execute, you might not see the error message.

This is because Zeabur does not output standard error (stderr) messages by default. You can redirect the standard error (stderr) messages to the standard output (stdout) to see the error messages.

In short, add `2>&1` at the end of the command, for example:

```bash
mysql -u nosuchuser 2>&1
```
