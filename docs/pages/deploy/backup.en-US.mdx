# Backup Service

In production environments and during development, you may need to create backups of your services to enhance the robustness and reliability of your applications.
We provide a straightforward method for creating and recovering backups for all Prebuilt Services deployed on Zeabur.

<Callout>
    The previously mentioned [Prebuilt Service](/prebuilt/intro), which belongs to the service category, is a subcategory of services. [Prebuilt Service](/prebuilt/intro) is a stateful service, unlike `Git Service`, which is stateless. Therefore, `Git Service` does not support backup functionality.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Create a backup

Open the [Zeabur dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com) and navigate to the service page that you want to back up and open the **Backup** tab, and you will see a button to create a backup for your service.

Click on the Backup button, and we will automatically create a backup for your service. This process may take some time.

<Callout>
    We only support creating backups without suspending the service for databases, including MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis.
    For other services, you will need to suspend the service first in the service settings before creating a backup.
    You can restart the service after the backup is created.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Download the Backup

After the backup is created, you will see a **SUCCESS** message. Click on the download button to download the backup file.

Once you have the downloaded file, you can unzip it and view its contents.
