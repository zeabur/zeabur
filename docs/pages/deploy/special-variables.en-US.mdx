# Special Variables

"Special Variables" are environment variables that are predefined by Zeabur and can be directly used.
They can be used in Git and Prebuilt services.

## Referencing

- In the environment variable input box in Zeabur: Use the `${VARIABLE}` format to insert special variables.
- In your own application: Use the same method as referencing an environment variables (`process.env.VARIABLE`).

## Variable Priority Order

The order of expansion for variables within a service is as follows:

- Environment variables defined by the current service will be obtained first.
- If not defined, environment variables exposed by other services will be obtained.
- If not defined, special variables will be obtained.

## Variables

### Hostname/Port

- `${ZEABUR_[PORTNAME]_URL}`: The URL corresponding to a specific port.
  - For example, `https://test.zeabur.app`.
  - This URL is that one you set in the "Domain" section:

    ![Domain Port Customization](/deploy/special-variables/domain-port-customization.png)

- `${ZEABUR_[PORTNAME]_DOMAIN}`: The domain corresponding to a specific port.
  - For example, `test.zeabur.app`.
  - This URL is that one you set in the "Domain" section.
- `${CONTAINER_HOSTNAME}`: The hostname of the current service in the Zeabur project.
    - Usually, we create an environment variable with the Expose property (e.g., `${MYSQL_HOST}`),
      and then fill in the value of `${CONTAINER_HOSTNAME}` in this environment variable.
    - However, if you want to reference the hostname of another service within Zeabur, we recommend using the DNS feature that Zeabur will release in the future.
- `${[PORTNAME]_PORT}`: The port defined in the Prebuilt service.
    - For example, if you set `database / 3306 / TCP`, then `DATABASE_PORT` will be `3306`.
    - Only visible within the current service.

### Zeabur Information

These variables are not commonly used, but if you need the unique identifiers of the current Zeabur service/project,
these variables will be very helpful.

- `${ZEABUR_SERVICE_ID}`: Service ID
- `${ZEABUR_PROJECT_ID}`: Project ID
- `${ZEABUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID}`: Service environment ID
- `${ZEABUR_USER_ID}`: User ID who created this project

### Git Information

These variables will only appear during the build phase of the Git service.

- `${ZEABUR_GIT_COMMIT_SHA}`: The Git commit SHA value that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_AUTHOR}`: The Git commit author ID that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_BRANCH}`: The Git branch name that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_REPO_NAME}`: The Git repository name that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_REPO_OWNER}`: The Git repository owner ID that the current deployment belongs to.
- `${ZEABUR_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE}`: The Git commit message that the current deployment belongs to.

### Utilities

- `${PASSWORD}`: A random password generated by Zeabur for each service.
