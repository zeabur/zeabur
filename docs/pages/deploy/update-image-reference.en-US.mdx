# Update Image Reference of the Docker Service

Zeabur allows you to update the image reference of a service after it has been created. This is useful when you want to update the image of a service to a newer version or a different image, or switching your service to a different image.

<Callout type="info">
    Only the **Docker service** can update the image reference. Git and Once services cannot change the image tag since there is no image tag.
</Callout>

## Update tag

“Tag” is the part of the image reference that specifies the version of the image. For example, in the image reference `nginx:latest`, `latest` is the tag. You can update the tag to switch to a different version of the image.

Open the “Settings” tab of your service, you will see a section “Service Image”. Here you can update the image reference of your service.

Click and modify the tag part of the image reference (which is the second input field), you can see the **Save** button that allows you to apply your new tag.

![update tag](/deploy/update-image-reference/update-tag.webp)

After saving the changes, Zeabur will automatically restart your service with the new image reference. If it cannot be pulled, Zeabur will instruct you to modify the image reference again.

## Update repository

“Repository” is the part of the image reference that specifies the image name. For example, in the image reference `nginx:latest`, `nginx` is the repository. You can update the repository to switch to a different image.

Open the “Settings” tab of your service, you will see a section “Service Image”. Here you can update the image repository of your service.

Click and modify the repository part of the image reference (which is the first input field), you can see the **Save** button that allows you to apply your new repository.

After saving the changes, Zeabur will automatically restart your service with the new image reference. If it cannot be pulled, Zeabur will instruct you to modify the image reference again.
