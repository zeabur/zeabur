# Enable Serverless

Currently, Zeabur supports Serverless deployment for these languages/frameworks:

- [Node.js](/guides/nodejs)
- [Golang](/guides/go)
- [Python](/guides/python)
- [Rust](/guides/rust)

## Try it in your own Zeabur service

Add `ZBPACK_SERVERLESS=1` in the "Environment Variables" column and click "Redeploy."
Your service will be deployed as a serverless service.

## Declare as a serverless service

In the root directory of your service's source code, create a `zbpack.json` file
(or modify it if it already exists) and add the following content:

```json
{
  "serverless": true
}
```

This will declare that your service can be deployed in a serverless form,
and Zeabur will automatically deploy it in serverless mode.

## Revert to containerized mode

If you are certain that your service does not support serverless mode (for example, if it has important
background tasks), it is recommended to change the `serverless` field in `zbpack.json` to `false`.
Unless you manually set `ZBPACK_SERVERLESS` in the future, Zeabur will not deploy your service in
serverless mode.

If you just want to test if the traditional container mode works properly, add `FORCE_CONTAINERIZED=1`
to the environment variables and redeploy to switch back to the traditional container mode.
This variable is enabled for old services by default.
