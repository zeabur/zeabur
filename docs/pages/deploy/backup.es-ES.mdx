# Backup Service
In production environments and during development, you may need to create backups of your services to enhance the robustness and reliability of your applications.
We provide a straightforward method for creating and recovering backups for all Prebuilt Services deployed on Zeabur.

<Callout>
    The previously mentioned [Prebuilt Service](/prebuilt/intro), which belongs to the service category, is a subcategory of services. [Prebuilt Service](/prebuilt/intro) is a stateful service, unlike `Git Service`, which is stateless. Therefore, `Git Service` does not support backup functionality.

## Step 1: Suspend Your Service
Before creating a backup, please suspend your service to prevent data loss during the backup process. If your service is running, the system will prompt you to suspend it.

At this point, you can open the Settings tab, find the Danger Zone section, and click the Suspend Service button to suspend your service.

Select the service you wish to back up, expand the Backup tab, and you will see a button to create a backup for your service.

## Step 4: Download the Backup
After waiting for a while, you will see that the backup has been successfully created. The Backup tab will display SUCCESS. Click here to download the backup file.

Once you have the downloaded file, you can unzip it and view its contents.
