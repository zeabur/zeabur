# Deploying with Dockerfile

Normally, you don't need to write a `Dockerfile` by yourself. Zeabur currently provides fast deployment methods for various popular frameworks, but if your project is not using these frameworks or you want to define your own deployment method, you can use a `Dockerfile` to deploy it.

<Callout type="warning">
  Zeabur currently only supports Dockerfile deployment and does not provide Docker Compose deployment.
</Callout>

## Creating a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` or `dockerfile` in the root directory of your project and write your deployment method in it. Finally, make sure you have exposed the corresponding `PORT`.

Zeabur will automatically detect if your project has a `Dockerfile`. If so, it will deploy your project using Docker.

<Callout type="info">
  After the deployment starts, you can see the Docker icon above, which means your project has been deployed using Docker.
</Callout>

## Environment Variables

If your `Dockerfile` needs to use environment variables, you can click **Environment Variables** on the service page to add them. For more settings, please refer to [Environment Variables](/en-US/environment/variables).

If your `Dockerfile` is written in one stage, or if your environment variables only need to be used in the final stage, you don't need to manually write `ENV`. Zeabur will automatically add it for you.

### ARG

However, if your `Dockerfile` is written in multiple stages ([multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)), and you need to set environment variables before building, you can use `ARG` to set them.

Here, we take nodejs and nginx as an example to write a `Dockerfile` for deployment.

```docker {7-8} copy
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

## The `BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE` here will be set before building automatically
ARG BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE
ENV BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE=${BUILDTIME_ENV_EXAMPLE}

RUN npm install && \
    npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/configfile.template
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

ENV \
    PORT=8080 \
    HOST=0.0.0.0

EXPOSE 8080

CMD sh -c "envsubst '\$PORT' < /etc/nginx/conf.d/configfile.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
```

## Creating Dockerfiles for the specific services in a Monorepo

If you want to deploy different projects in a monorepo, you can create `Dockerfile.[service-name]` (or `[service-name].Dockerfile`) and deploy the specified Dockerfile using the service name.

For example, if you want to deploy three microservices that use the same Git Repository, you can name your Dockerfiles as follows:

-  `Dockerfile.storage` (or `storage.Dockerfile`): deploys the Node.js `storage` microservice
-  `Dockerfile.discord` (or `discord.Dockerfile`): deploys the Node.js `discord` microservice
-  `Dockerfile.frontend` (or `frontend.Dockerfile`): deploys the Next.js `frontend` frontend

After deploying your project on Zeabur, navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Service Name" and change the value to the desired service name (e.g., `storage`, `discord`, or `frontend`) as shown in the above example.

Click "Redeploy" to redeploy the project, and you will see your desired service deployed. You can also set [Watch Paths](./watch-paths) to trigger deployment only when the corresponding files are modified.

## Docker Compose

Zeabur currently only supports `Dockerfile` deployment and does not provide Docker Compose deployment.
